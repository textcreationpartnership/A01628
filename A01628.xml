            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Lorious doubtles,</hi> and which may vehementlye moue the mindes of all men, is the promiſe and warrant of humane Philoſophie: for by it (they ſay) men are perfected, and brought to the knowledge of the ſoueraigne trueth: by
<pb facs="tcp:21193:4"/>it men are taught how to frame beſt their manners &amp; conuerſation: by it mens mindes are armed againſt all aſſaultes of fortune ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubtilly fawning or enuiouſly inſulting: finally, by it is ſhewed a way, wherby a man may attaine vnto happy life and immortality. But it we weigh the matter indifferently, we ſhall finde that onely from our Diuinitie all theſe thinges may exactly be perfourmed. For why? eche one perceiueth, that naturall men, by whom all thoſe thinges are gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that are ſet to ſale vnder the name of Philoſophie, doo all erre and faile in many thinges: but vnto God, who hath written and put foorth deuine matters as onely beſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to him ſelfe, no ſuch thing may poſſiblye be aſcribed. Wherby it commeth to paſſe, that in the writinges of the Philoſophers, wherein they labour to ſet out the trueth, a man may finde euery where mixte opinions very abſurd and contrary one to another, wher upon ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth greater doubtfulnes then certaintie. A witnes heereof I haue that notable Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher M. <hi>Vario,</hi> who hath left in writing, that as touching the endes of good and euill, there were extant at once, two hundreth foureſcore and eight ſundry ſects and opinions.</p>
                     <p>But when they would frame and order a
<pb facs="tcp:21193:4"/>Cittie, a familie, or the manners of euery pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate man, good God, what colde ſtuffe, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes how yll agreeing together haue they broached and put foorth? To ſay nothing, that by ſome haue béene propounded ſuch thinges to be brought into Common-weales (the Communion of <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges is well knowne) as from the which all men endued with any common ſence of nature doo worthily flie and abhorre. But if at any time they couet to comfort a man ſtricken with aduerſitie, euen heere alſo they go very confuſedlye to woorke, whileſt ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> labour to remoue the very name of cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, as though it were a thing not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted off, wil ſome men to imagine I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tel what ſenſeleſnes, or want of greef, clean contrary to manifeſt experience: other ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine ſet before men eyes (painted in colours after a ſorte) a certain image of fortitude, ſuch as neuer was, nor neuer ſhalbe: and yet in the meane time they are neuer able to driue away care, feare, and the ſence of ſorrow and gréefe from their mindes. Now as touching the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed life after this painefull and troubleſome life to be looked for, iudge yee, whether any thing certaine be by them brought and allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, of whome the greateſt part count thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:21193:5"/>thinges for fables and trifles to be laughed at, which are brothed and ſet foorth of men like to themſelues, concerning the rewardes of good men and puniſhmentes of the euill, calling e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen into queſtion, whither there be any life at all remaining in the ſoule, or no.</p>
                     <p>But truely, Diuinitie is ſuch a thing, as may fully ſatiffie the mindes (deſirous of true wiſdome) of all theſe thinges. This, in a few ſacred bookes (for ſo are they called not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a cauſe) comprehendeth cléerely and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any error, what-ſoeuer is neceſſarye to make perfit and bring the whole man to true happines. In theſe bookes is the knowledge of the firſt and ſoueraigne trueth (which is God him ſelfe, and whoſe only woord is the trueth) ſo much as is expedient to be knowen of men in this life, plainely and ſubſtantially opened. In theſe the ſhort tables of the lawes doo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and ſet foorth all the whole rule of good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and the ſame in all reſpectes ſo abſolute and anſwerable to Gods will, that the prince of Prophets <hi>Moſes</hi> moſt iuſtly gloried, that there was neuer any people or nation, that had their Common weale ſo wiſelye ordered and eſtabliſhed (whither we conſider the rites appertaining to religion, or the iudiciall forme of lawes, or the manner of contractes and
<pb facs="tcp:21193:5"/>bargaines, and other thinges of like ſort néed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and neceſſary for the common vſe of mans life) as had the people of the Jewes, taught and inſtructed in all thinges by God himſelfe. In theſe are expreſſed and ſet foorth moſt perfit and preſent remedies, which auaile not onely to the eaſing and helping of outward euils, but alſo to the pacifying and appeaſing of mens conſciences, which béeing ſtricken with the feare of Gods moſt ſeuere iudgement ſhould otherwiſe be driuen into deſperation: of which matter Philoſophie hath touched no one iot or title. To be ſhort, in theſe onlye bookes, hath God him ſelf declared (which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deceiued) what a happy and bleſſed life is, in what pointes it conſiſteth, where, when by what meanes, and to what manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons it belongeth. So as he that wil beſtow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diligence at all in learning of theſe bookes, by the guiding of the holy Ghoſt, that man (whoſoeuer he be) ſhall well perceiue and ſee theſe thinges to be true as we haue ſaide.</p>
                     <p>For-ſo-much therfore as Diuinitie ſheweth her ſelfe a very excellent Miſtreſſe in all theſe thinges, and perfourmeth ſo much in deed as any man can poſſibly deſire, yet in comfortes and conſolations to be fitly miniſtred againſt all gréefes and calamities that can happen, ſhe
<pb facs="tcp:21193:6"/>is beyond all meaſure rich and bountifull, euen the mighty Apoſtle <hi>Paule</hi> himſelfe bearing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, who doubted not to ſay, that <hi>whatſoeuer things are written aforecime, are written for our learning, that through pacience and comfort of the Scriptures we might haue hope.</hi> For ſo doth God ſeeme for this cauſe eſpecially to haue ſent into the world at ſundry times his Prophets and Apoſtles to be witneſſes of his good will toward vs, and further to haue put in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Sermons and dooinges, to the end that men of all ages might haue amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And who I pray you) could either better or more effectually heale our maladies, then God him ſelf by his woord? who as he is the only ſearcher of the hartes, ſo he ſoone percetueth, where our ſore gréeueth vs: and as by his determinate purpoſe, though vnknowen vnto vs, he oftentimes ſendeth calamities for ſome ſpeciall benefite of ours ſo he onely and alone knoweth, after what ſorte and how long it is méet and conuenient for vs to be afflicted.</p>

For why? look how much diuine things excell humane, and ſo much alſo is it neceſſary that we preferre diuine comfortes before all Philoſophicall conſolations.</p>
                     <p>But for as much as in the holy Scripture many thinges are ſundrilye euery where ſet foorth, which may very much auaile to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of afflicted mindes (for ſome where are found places teaching the vanitie &amp; contempt of all earthly things: ſome-where are rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed moſt large and ample promiſes touching the dignitie of heauenly benefites to be looked

<pb facs="tcp:21193:8"/>we haue thought good for the cauſe afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaide, ſo much as ſhall be conuenient for our purpoſe, to ſtand vpon and handle And to the intent we may reape the more plentifull crop of conſolations, I ſuppoſe it will be for our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofe, if we vnfolde it ſome-what the more at large.</p>
                     <p>Béeing about therfore to ſpeake of Gods prouidence, we déeme theſe principall pointes following, as moſt requiſite to be handled.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that we open and declare, what is to be vnderſtood by the name of <hi>Prouidence,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ther-unto the teſtimonies of Scripture, wherby it may appéere plainly both that there is a <hi>Prouidence,</hi> and that alſo ſuch a one, as wée haue defined it to bée.

                     <p>Secondly, wherein it differeth from Gods predeſtination, foreknowledge and wiſdome: and that the <hi>Prouidence</hi> of God is not only v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall, but alſo particuler: diſpatching ſome thinges, which are woont to be alleadged to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly wée will prooue, that neither <hi>chance</hi> nor fortune, nor deſtinie, nor haphazard can rightlye bee mainteined, where there is due
<pb facs="tcp:21193:8"/>knowledge of Gods <hi>Prouidence,</hi> and the ſame woorthily eſtéemed.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, wée wil bréefly diſcuſſe, whether Gods <hi>Prouidence</hi> impoſeth neceſſitie vppon thinges prouided, or no.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, wée will diligently declare, how out of all thoſe thinges that haue béene ſpoken of Gods <hi>Prouidence,</hi> godlye mindes ought to fetch matter of conſolation, and ſo to reape moſt ample frute by the knowledge of diuine <hi>Prouidence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sirtly to the intent we may the more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ordinately teach, that againſt all ſorts of daungers there are certaine remedies alſo appointed by Gods prouidence, wée will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprete and expounde the <hi>107.

                     <p>All which thinges being thus declared, we will adde a few woordes touching the generall comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation of the knowledge of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, and the right vſe of Diuine conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſo wil we make an end of our preſent diſcourſe.</p>

                     <p>And out of theſe ſo many and ſo manifeſt feſtimonies may abundantly appéer the truth and integritie of the definition which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alleadged. We ſaide that <hi>Prouidence</hi> is a certaine diſpoſition and adminiſtration, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueting (vndoubtedly) by theſe two woordes to ſhew and declare, that euen before any things come to paſſe, and likewiſe alſo when they are accompliſhed and brought to paſſe, the diuine power is grauely and ſeriouſly occupied (ſo far
<pb facs="tcp:21193:11"/>foorth as is beſéeming to his Maieſtie) about them For we may not ſo take the matter that God dooth only once determine with himſelfe, how euery thing ought to be ordered, and then afterward commit y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> buſines vnto ſome other inferior cauſes, to proſecute the things that he before ordayned, and to bring them to their end: but we muſt vnderſtand that he dooth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually put to his hand, vntill that which is moſt wiſely ordained, be moſte mightily ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued and throughly accompliſhed.</p>
                     <p>Otherwiſe <hi>Prouidence</hi> ſhould bee no whit more excellent then bare <hi>fore-knowledge:</hi> and the tytle indéed of admmiſtration might be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed vnto God, but the thing it ſelfe ſhould ſeeme not greatly to belong vnto him. Like as many thinges are doone in the name of Kings and Princes, and are ſaid to be diſpatched by their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, which notwithſtanding they ſcarce know or vnderſtand, how and after what ſorte they come to paſſe, becauſe they are doon by other miniſters. But the caſe ſtandeth not ſo with God. Hée alone not only purpoſeth and ordayneth all things but alſo ordereth and adminiſtreth them. Neither yet ought he to be vnderſtood ſo to adminiſter thinges, as one ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly or at aduenture dooing this or that, like as thoſe men are wont to doo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are diſtracted
<pb facs="tcp:21193:11"/>with many matters &amp; dealinges: but he with a certaine purpoſe and determination, and to endes lawfull and good, like vnto men wiſely and long time deliberating of thinges to be doone, finiſheth and accompliſheth all thinges. Otherwiſe all thinges ſhould be carried head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with a certaine blinde and doubtfull mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and <hi>Prouidence</hi> ſhould little differ from chance and fortune: and if any thing ſuccéeded well, or came to good paſſe, it might ſeeme to be attributed to chaunce: as it is wont to be doone, where without any deliberation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had, ſome Captain ſodenly and at a wilde venture breaking vpon his enemies, obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth yet the victorie: which doubtleſſe is ſaide to come to paſſe rather by haphazard then by any direction of the will or wiſdome. But of God vndoubtedly, whoſe wiſdome reacheth mightily from one end vnto an other, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth all things ſweetleye and comfortablye, we may not ſo ſpeake. We ſuppoſe therfore that this laſt propertie may plainly and fitly be expreſſed by the woord <hi>Diſpoſition,</hi> and that other by the woord <hi>Adminiſtration,</hi> and ſo that no ſmall force of Gods prouidence is opened in thoſe two woordes. We ſaid y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is a <hi>perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al adminiſtration,</hi> intending to ſignifie, that as Gods power and wiſdome are neuer idle or
<pb facs="tcp:21193:12"/>vnoccupied, ſo neither that the care and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thinges created, is euer at any time raſt aſide or remoued from him. For why? God woorketh not by turnes or fittes, as one that is ſometimes weary and requireth the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable helpe of a deputye, vnto whom he might commit the office of ſuſtaining and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping all thinges vpright: but he worketh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually without ceaſing all in all, and onely and alone bringeth all thinges to their appoin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted end. We ſaid that it is <hi>vnchangeable,</hi> to ſhowe, that in all thinges that come to paſſe, yea euen in baſe and inferior thinges, the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God is certaine and ſure: in as much as it is neceſſary that we attribute vnto God an euerlaſting decrée, ſtable purpoſe, and infal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lable wiſdome, for why? God is not changed, neither dooth he onely purpoſe and begin, but alſo performe and accompliſh: yea and looke what he hath once decreede it ſhall come to paſſe, whatſoeuer is ſaide or doone to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. As touching the forces of mans will, whither they be able to doo any thing in this behalfe, we will declare in place conuenient. Laſt of all we ſaide that it is of <hi>All thinges,</hi> to the end that it might appeere that all thinges both great and ſmall are ſubiect to Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence. For if in cace any thing could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
<pb facs="tcp:21193:12"/>in minde, that might ſpring or be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from any other where then from the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God: we ſhould of neceſſitie either imagine ſome other beginning equall to God him ſelfe, from whom that thing ſhould come and procéed: or els at the leaſte that the ſame thing ſo ſprung vp of it ſelfe, and ſtanding by his owne ſtrength, had a hidden power of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie in it, and were euen a new God: which once to thinke or ſpeake is abhominable. But this particle ſhalbe declared more at large, when we come to ſpeake of particular proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. In the mean ſeaſon where all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> partes are in this wiſe more deepely weighed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, doubtleſſe there is conceiued a certain wonderfull maieſtie of Gods prouidence, and mens mindes may ſecretlye be ſtirred vp to woorſhip and adore the ſame. And hitherto, whither there be any Prouidence of God, and next what it is, I ſuppoſe it be ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
                     <p>But we haue yet to deale againſt thoſe men, that beeing prouoked with I wotte not what perſwaſions of mans corrupt reaſon, dare preſume to deny prouidence. Theſe mens reaſons we will bring foorth, and leaſt any mans mind ſhould be moued by them to erre, we will cleerely confute them. Then will we
<pb facs="tcp:21193:13"/>adde other argumentes alſo of mans reaſon, which may confirme euery man in the right knowledge of Gods prouidence. Theſe are the argumentes of the deniers of it.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>1.</hi> That is onely to be attributed vnto God, which is beſeeming to his Mateſtie, and wherin his dignitie is extolled and not depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or obſcured. But if the care of humane things be attributed vnto god, his maieſtie in this point ſeemeth not a little to be hurt, &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much to be detracted from his dignitie and woorthines. For what is this els, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to thruſt God from his celeſtiall glorye, and to drawe him downe into this filthy mire of worldlye thinges? Therfore it is not to be thought, that God careth for mens matters, and leaſt of all for thoſe that are more vile and baſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man. Which argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is recorded for the moſt part in <hi>Plime,</hi> where he ſpeaketh in this ſorte: <hi>It is a thing doubtleſſe to be laughed at, to ſaye, that the thing which is cheefeſt aboue all other, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for mens affaires. Should wee not beleeue or doubt that he is defiled with ſo heauye and comberſome a miniſterye?</hi> And it flowed from out of the ſchoole of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> which denyed not God indeed, as did <hi>Diagoras, Melius</hi> and ſuch like: but yet notwithſtanding he imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that if he would be happy and bleſſed in
<pb facs="tcp:21193:13"/>déede, he muſt be altogither idle, and voide of all care. For ſo <hi>Epicurus</hi> being vanquiſhed with the weaknes of his own braine, thought that prouidence could not be eſtabliſhed, but with the great trouble and vexation of God, as though God were after the manner of men ſubiect to affections, and could be gréeued and oppreſſed with troubles.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>2.</hi> If God regarded thinges humane, then all thinges ſhould be doon in due order, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as were conuenient to the iuſtice and goodnes of God. But we ſee openly and almoſt commonly that all things are boone moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly and out of order, and that with euill men it goeth well, and contrariwiſe with good men, ill. Therfore there is no prouidence of God, and god regardeth not humane affaires. Which argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t alſo is confirmed with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſimilitude. Like as neither a houſe nor Common-weale is ſaide to be eſtabliſhed in due order &amp; diſcipline, if in it there be neither rewards appointed for good déeds, nor puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes for defaultes: ſo ſéemeth the worlde not to be gouerned by diuine moderation. And this argument is of moſt weight and hath mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued very much the mindes euen of wiſe men, For ſéeing moſt vile and wretched perſons, ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes, traitors and ſuch like, to enioye good
<pb facs="tcp:21193:14"/>ſucceſſe, and to liue long in happy ſtate and condition, and contrarily all thinges to fal out vnhappily to the good and vertuous, and ofte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be very deſpitefullye handled of the wicked, and to be diſpatched out of the waye, at the leaſt to come very ſeldome to any good point or iſſue: they could iudge no other, but that God in very deede was not acquainted with mens matters, and much leſſe had any care of them: according as it is reported that <hi>Diogenes Cynicus</hi> was wunt to ſay, that <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palus</hi> (who in thoſe daies was counted a very happy and fortunate théefe) bare witneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Gods, becauſe he liued ſo long time in that eſtate and condition. Yea the Saintes and holy men haue beene moued ſomtimes by this conſideration, to ſuſpect, that they had vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly béene forſaken of God, and that God had no manner of care of them.

<pb facs="tcp:21193:14"/>ſhould chéefely appéere by this, that he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto man reaſon, which in very deed ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be as a certaine teſtimonye of Gods diuine power and goodnes alwaies conuerſant and abiding with men. But this waye it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>péereth not ſufficiently that man is prouided for. Therfore God paſſeth not for mens mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The <hi>minor</hi> or ſecond propoſition is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. For from the reaſon which God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto man, there ariſe dayly more euils &amp; inconueniences vnto him the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> benefites or good turnes. Therfore either God careth not for mens matters, or it had béene much better if man had not had reaſon giuen vnto him at al, then to be giuen with ſo great diſcommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. This proofe is confirmed by a ſimilitude: like as wine becauſe it ſildome times helpeth, but oftentimes hurteth ſick folkes, is better not to be miniſtred vnto them at all, then to be dangerouſly taken: euen ſo reaſon, in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it ſeemeth to procure more hurt vnto man then good, it had beene better not to be giuen vnto him at all, then ſo bountifully and largely to be giuen.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the chéefe argumentes, being of greateſt weight and moment: out of which all other, if any be alleadged, doo for the moſt part flowe and proceed. Theſe then we will in
<pb facs="tcp:21193:15"/>fewe woordes diſpatch.</p>
                     <p>To the firſte it is anſwered by denying the <hi>Minor</hi> or ſecond propoſition. For why? Gods Maieſtie is not heere diminiſhed, but rather becommeth more famous and notable. The mo thinges that God dooth, the more ſhineth foorth his power and goodnes in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And God is no more defiled with the care of thinges earthly and vile, then the Sunne is defiled by ſhining euen vpon foule and filthy places. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt we imagine that God is proud, and a contemner of the thinges that he humſelfe hath created, as though he ſhould deſpiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as vnwoorthy of him ſelf: and much leſſe that he ſéeketh his eaſe, as though he ſhould at any time be wearied with labour. Wherfore it is no ſtrange matter for God, to take vnto him ſelfe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> care of things earthly. But if any reply and ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euen Kings regarde not all things, ſpecialy ſuch as are of leaſt accompt, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore déem it a thing very vnméet, that the care of inferiour matters ſhould be attributed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God: doubtleſſe theſe men are much decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Theſe men wil take vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to iudge of diuine matters by thinges humane. But this ſimilitude is of no force. For why? Kinges are compelled to commit many things vnto other, becauſe in very deed they are not able to doo all
<pb facs="tcp:21193:15"/>thinges of them-ſelues: but the caſe ſtandeth not ſo with God. He needeth not the helpe of a ſubſtitute or deputie: he is able to bring to paſſe whatſoeuer he will Neither is any thing vnwoorthy of God, that is turned vnto good. But whatſoeuer is doon by him, is turned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to good: if not vnto good in reſpect of vs, yet certes vnto good in reſpect of God him ſelfe, that is to ſaye, to the illuſtration and ſetting foorth of his power, goodnes &amp; wiſdome which is ſufficient. But of this thing more at large, when we ſhall entreate of particular Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                     <p>To the ſecond it is anſwered by denying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the <hi>Minor:</hi> becauſe that in this is the iudgement of mans reaſon deceiued, for that it cannot diſcern the cauſes, for which God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineth theſe things ſo to come to paſſe in the worlde.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, reaſon cannot iudge, that all men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently are ſinners before God, &amp; that none can be found ſo holy, but that he hath deſerued the wrath of God. This if reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could perceiue it might vnderſtand that it is by no meanes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt order or iuſtice, that euen good men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are afflicted in this worlde.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, reaſon fayleth in this poynte, in that it ſuppoſeth al theſe euils to be ſent from
<pb facs="tcp:21193:16"/>God béeing angry, and to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deſtruction of men: when as notwithſtanding the Scripture ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly teacheth, that ſcourges are oft-times tokens of Gods good will (for whome the Lord looueth, them he chaſtizeth: <hi>Heb. 12. Prouerb. 3</hi>) and likewiſe for the behoofe &amp; profit of the good that are afflicted. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly by this meanes are excerciſed and growe forward in faith, they are ſtirred vp to inuocation of God, to pacience and charitie toward their neighbour, they are ſtrengthned in hope &amp;c. But contrariwiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites &amp; happy ſucceſſe doo turne for the moſte parte to mens deſtruction. For by them men are eſtranged from God, they conceiue bolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and contempt againſt their bretheren, yea they are blinded by little and little, vntill at length they come vtterly to confuſion.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, albeit God ſendeth euills and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities vnto good men as puniſhing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and beeing angry with them, yet he dooth it, whileſt they liue heere in this worlde, leaſt after they be departed, they ſhould be compelled to ſuffer in an other worlde (<hi>we are chaſtned of the Lord,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>
                           <hi>1. Corinth. 11.</hi> to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent we ſhould not be conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned with the world</hi>) and ſo be ſubiect to euerlaſting torments. But to the wicked and vngodly, he graunteth all thinges proſperous here in this life, to the end
<pb facs="tcp:21193:16"/>that afterward they may ſo much the more iuſtly be damned, and ſeuerely puniſhed. Of which thing we haue a teſtimony in the Euan gelicall example of <hi>Lazarus</hi> and the rich man.</p>
                     <p>Theſe cauſes I ſay, wherin both the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes and goodnes of God dooth appeere, the holy Scripture propoundeth vnto vs: but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon beeing deſtitute of the woord: cannot ſee or perceiue them. Wherfore it is manifeſt, in this behalfe, to wit, in that the godly are puniſhed heere, and the wicked not ſo, that we muſt not ſay, that therfore thinges are heere diſorderly doon: when as all theſe thinges are for certain profitable cauſes, and vnto iuſt &amp; lawful endes directed by Gods diſpenſation. But as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the fore ſaid ſimilitude, we aunſwer that all thinges are not héere alike. For why<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>in the Common-weale, it is a thing neceſſary in deed to be obſerued, that to the euill puniſhments ſhould be inflicted, and rewardes to the good: becauſe that without this conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neither could publique peace and tranquilitie ſtand, neither any order be kept and retayned. But in the adminiſtration of the world, albeit the godly are afflicted, and the wicked eſcape, yet remaine all things ſtill in good order, and God turneth that inequalitie vnto a good end and purpoſe.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:21193:17"/>
                     <p>To the third argument it is anſwered, that God indéed hath adorned man with that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent gifte of reaſon, wherby he might not onely ſurmount all other creatures, but alſo haue in him ſelfe a certaine teſtimonye of the diuine power alwaies preſent and woorking in him. For in this reſpect man is ſaide to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated after the likenes of God, and to beare the image of God about him. But in ſuch wiſe did God giue it to the firſt man, that he put it in his choice and power, to vſe the ſame fréelye either vnto good or euill. When therfore man turned it vnto euill, and alſo to his owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, doubtleſſe the fault was to be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto him ſelfe, who ſo ſhamefully abuſed ſo great a benefite. Wherfore it followeth not that it had beene better not to haue beene gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto man, then to be giuen with ſo great diſcommodities: for it was giuen to a good end, and he might haue vſed it well if he had would: in which behalfe doubtleſſe God had aboundantly prouided for man. But after the fall of man, albeit all men are caried more pronely vnto euill then vnto good, and that there remaineth ſcarce one little ſparke of mans libertie, yet for all that reaſon abideth ſtill not ſo farre foorth in all reſpectes depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and peruerted, but that it is a very eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb facs="tcp:21193:17"/>marke of Gods image, and teſtifieth that God hath euen ſtill a care of mortall men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as we may ſée a number by the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding therof to be ledde and prepared (after a ſorte) vnto good. More-ouer God dooth ſtil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the minde and reaſon, ſecretly ſtirreth them vnto vertue and goodnes, woorking al in in all: as touching which thing we haue often and many ſentences in the Scriptures, and ſome we haue cited before. It is euident ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that God dooth prouide for mens mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Now without any buſines may other reaſons be anſwered that are wont to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, of which ſorte is this: If God, ſay they, haue prouided for man in giuing him reaſon, then for thoſe onely hath he prouided, vpon whom he hath beſtowed good reaſon, which vndoubtedly are very fewe, and almoſt none at all. But it is an abſurd thing to ſay, that God prouideth onely for ſome few, neglecting or excluding others: It followeth therfore, that no man is prouided for. We ſaye that God would indéede prouide indifferentlye for all men, like as he hath indifferently giuen to all men the benefite of reaſon: but in that ſome doo vſe it better then other ſome, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth for the moſt parte in the men the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues But if they yet procéeding further wil inferre,
<pb facs="tcp:21193:18"/>that euen God him ſelfe alſo is to be blamed, who hath giuen reaſon vnto theſe, whome he knew would vſe the ſame péeniſhlye and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly: like as that Phiſition is not without faulte, that granteth to his patient wine, and yet knoweth well enough that if he take it without mixture, it will ſoone turn to his bane and poyſon. Heere the conſequence is deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For albeit God knewe before that man would abuſe the benefite of reaſon, yet was it conuenient in the meane time for Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, to decke and adorne man with moſt large and ample giftes, to the intent that afterward the whole blame might ſo much the more iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be laide vpon him, in whoſe choice it was to vſe the commoditie receiued either well or ill. Furthermore conſidering that God alſo fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knew, how and by what meanes to ſuccour and prouide for man againe being fallen, and how greatly his glory, power and goodnes ought to be aduaunced and ſet foorth by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring againe: conſidering likewiſe that God was by no lawe bound vnto man, to keep him from falling: certes he cannot be iudged to haue doon either vnwiſely or vniuſtly, in ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning man with reaſon that was afterward to fall, and in ſuffring him to ſlide.</p>
                     <p>But againſt theſe arguments now propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb facs="tcp:21193:18"/>we will ſet other again much more ſtrong and forceable, proouing the prouidence of God to the intent that if any be offended any way with the former, the ſame may haue reaſons fetched euen from nature it ſelfe, by the which they may againe ſtrengthen and confirm their mindes, for although the Scripture ought to bée of ſuch account w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all men, that looke what the ſame hath once pronounced, ſhould be recei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued with all diligence: yet notwithſtanding ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by reaſon of the aduerſaries, that imbrace not the Scripture: or for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weakes ſake, whoſe reaſon euermore ſtill ſtrugleth &amp; ſtriueth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther willingly ſubmitteth it ſelf to the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the woord: It is profitable ſome-times to bring forth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> arguments of reaſon, not veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the end that by them that which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woord of God ſhould be confirmed, but to the intent that they ſhould ſerue and waite vpon Gods woord. For otherwiſe in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry déede they are not to be receiued. Let this therfore be the firſt reaſon.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 If there be a God, it is neceſſary and requi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſite that he be occupied, and that truly about ſomwhat very excellent and woorthy of God.

But there is no ſuch thing to be foüd, that is either more mighty or more wiſe then God, for otherwiſe God ſhould not be almighty and moſt wiſe. Therfore is the world gouerned by God himſelfe.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Now, Foreknowledge is that, wherby all things aſwel forepaſt, as to come are by them ſelues knowen vnto God, and that in ſuch ſort as though they were preſent and before his eyes. For God foreknoweth all thinges, not verely as foreſeeing onely what ſhall become héerafter of this or that, as men ſometime are ſaid to foreknowe certaine thinges, or at the leaſt preſume as though they foreknew them:
<pb facs="tcp:21193:22"/>neither yet as one conceiuing a naked fourme or figure onely in his mynde, like as there is woont to wander in our imaginations, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſhape and image of thoſe thinges which either wee haue ſeene before, or looke to ſée af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward: but viewing and beholding al things whether they bée paſt or to come, as though they were preſent, and that truely with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular certaintie and moſte perfit knowledge. Wherfore alſo it is rather called Foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge then Foreſight. For why? in God there cannot be ſeene or diſcerned any proportion of the time paſt or to come (for he ſurmou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth all times, béeing him ſelf ſet farre abooue all meaſure and quantitie of time) wherfore it is neceſſarie that wée conclude, that all thinges are knowen vnto him as though they were preſent: and further that no new or ſtraunge thing happeneth vnto him, when the thinges which hée foreknewe come to paſſe: as who ſhould ſay, hée then receiued the knowledge, of thoſe thinges, of which before he had onely the foreknowledge, according as we are wont to ſay of a man: but we muſt auouch al and the whole Foreknowledge to be in God ſimply as knowledge, like as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> wittily writeth to <hi>Simplicianus</hi> Booke <hi>2.</hi> Queſt. <hi>2.</hi> And albeit <hi>Cicero</hi> dooth deny the Foreknowledge of God
<pb facs="tcp:21193:22"/>in his ſecond book of <hi>Diuination,</hi> where diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with his brother <hi>Quintus</hi> he laboureth to take away all foreſight or fore-iudgement of things to come as wel from God as from men: that maketh no great matter. He truely is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to him ſelfe, who after that he had in one place very grauely determined of prouidence, héer he moſt childiſhly denieth foreknowledge, when as that without this can by no meanes be vnderſtood in God. But he that coueteth to knowe more againſt this vanitie of <hi>Cicero,</hi> let him read <hi>Auguſtine de Ciuitate Dei. Lib. 5. Cap. 9.</hi> throughout which Chapter there is a very apte diſputation ſet downe as touching this whole matter.</p>
                     <p>But Wiſdome, wherby God is ſaid often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcriptures to haue created &amp; to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uern al things, is taken to be a certaine power more largely ſtretching it ſelf, wherby he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knoweth, predeſtinateth, and prouideth or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrateth all things rightly and ordinarily to his own glory, to our profit, and the vtilitie and ornament of all things created: and is ſaid to doo all thinges wiſely.</p>
                     <p>And that we may contract all thinges into a ſumme, predeſtination is occupied cheefely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the eternall ſaluation and damnation of men, which is to follow after this life: proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb facs="tcp:21193:23"/>is occupied in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> adminiſtration of thoſe thinges which by an euerlaſting and infallible ſucceſſion come to paſſe, throughout the whole world, and through the whole life of men. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination tendeth directlye to the laſt end: prouidence directeth the meanes that belong ther-unto. Foreknowledge dooth nothing els, then moſt aduiſedlye conſider all thinges that are to come, paſte, and preſent: Finallye, wiſdome may be weighed as a certaine ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall facultie and moſt largely ſpreading it ſelf, vſually applyed vnto all thinges that GOD dooth. Predeſtination cannot be without fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, but fore-knowledge may well be without Predeſtination. Prouidence alſo is not without fore-knowledge, neuertheleſſe fore-knowledge may ſtand againe without prouidence. But without wiſdome, neither fore-knowledge, nor predeſtination, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, no nor any thing els that God dooth, can ſtand or conſiſt. Therfore, that predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, fore-knowledge, and wiſoome doo differ one from another, and alſo from prouidence, it is héerby plaine and euident.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore theſe thinges beeing thus declared, a waye is after a ſorte opened to enquire, what maner of thing Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence is, what it dooth? what power it is
<pb facs="tcp:21193:23"/>of, and how it is occupied in the adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all thinges?

                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>2</hi> Other ſome, of whoſe number is <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> with his followers, haue ſomewhat more largely ſtretched the compaſſe of Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, although encloſed yt in certaine limits, attributing (as who ſaith) vnto it y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of ſupernall and celeſtiall thinges, which are next to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houſe of God, which houſe all men acknowledge to be heauen: but that hee ſhould paſſe any further, deſcending to thinges belowe, where he might peruſe and ſet in order the earth and earthly things, that they ſuppoſe to be vnbeſéeming ſo great a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie.

<pb facs="tcp:21193:24"/>vertue to be conneighed from the diuine nature by one and the ſelfe-ſame ſimple moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into the thinges which are next vnto it, that is to ſaye the heauens: then from theſe likewiſe to flowe a new force and vertue vnto thoſe thinges which immediatlye follow, and and ſo forth on by a long courſe and order e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto the loweſt, ſo long and ſo farre forth as all thinges feele in themſelues any parte of the diuine moouing. The matter may be made more cléere by a ſimilitude. If a man take and drawe the firſte linke or ring of a chayne that is rolled together and laide vpon an heape, it is neceſſary that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forthwith the ſecond link alſo ſhould be moued, and ſo forth all the reſt, vntill the whole chaine doo follow whither ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he will: ſo iudge they Gods prouidence to deale in the adminiſtration of thinges, firſte forſooth in woorking vpon heauenlye thinges next adioyning, and then in paſſing by many thinges ſet betweene, to come by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle euen vnto the lower alſo. But if a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of them, why God moueth not by like reaſon all inferior thinges alſo: they anſwer, that it is not ſéemelye euen for Kinges them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, to knowe and vnderſtand all thinges: neither meete to be ſpoken, that God ſhould haue the charge of ſuch labours committed
<pb facs="tcp:21193:25"/>vnto him, as a vile ſlaue or ſcullion in a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Court would ſcarſe vndertake to doo.

                     <p n="3">3 From theſe differeth not much the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of others which haue likewiſe ſubiected to the prouidence of God all incorruptible thinges, that is to ſay heauenly and elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, then alſo thinges corruptible, but not all after one manner, as of which they ſuppoſed onely the kindes, but not the particulars to be preſerued by Gods prouidence. But further they made exception of man, by reaſon of his excellency from this common lawe of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible thinges, whom they affirmed to be ruled
<pb facs="tcp:21193:25"/>and gouerned of God by a ſpeciall and peculiar care. In this opinion were certaine men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with the Jewes Philoſophie, eſpeciallye <hi>Rabbi Moſe,</hi> (moued as I take it) to except man by thoſe places of Scripture, which doo moſt plainely teſtifie, that the holye Fathers were in all their woorkes, peregrinations, warres, mariages, prouiſion of thinges ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, ſingularlye halpen of God, and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with happy ſucceſſes.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 <hi>Plato,</hi> as <hi>Gregory Niſſene</hi> reporteth, hath otherwiſe yet deuided the functions of prouidence. For firſt he hath fourmed a certain prouidence of the high or ſoueraigne God, chéefely-occupyed in gouerning of things hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly and incorporall, and further alſo in the vniuerſall adminiſtration of the principall partes of the whole worlde, to the intent that the kindes and ſpecialties of thinges might by an euerlaſting order and ſucceſſion be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and preſerued If <hi>Plato</hi> had ſtayd heer, this opinion might haue ſeemed tollerable, as agreeing with thoſe that haue attributed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God an vniuerſall prouidence. But he as one diſtruſting the power of God, or as though he feared that God would be angry, if in caſe the charge alſo of ſmall and trifling thinges ſhould be committed vnto him: framed a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb facs="tcp:21193:26"/>ſecond prouidence, intentiuely occupied euen about all ſeuerall and particular things, which are ingendred throughout this whole world. This charge and function he took to be aſſigned to certaine inferior Gods, gouerning eſpecially the motions of the celeſtiall bodies, and then pouring a conuenient force into all inferior thinges. By meanes wherof it came to paſſe, that the blinde antiquitie feigned many Gods, whom they called <hi>Tutelares,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring <hi>Saturne</hi> to Corne ſowing, <hi>Mercury</hi> to Marchandize, ſome ouer the waters, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome (to be ſhort) ouer other things. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which gouernment of inferior and ſelect Gods in the worlde, thou maiſt finde ſome things in <hi>Auguſtine de Ciuitate Dei. libr. 7. chap. 2.3.</hi> Laſt of all he eſtabliſhed alſo a third prouidence, occupied in ruling of men and their actions, aſſigned againe vnto other Gods, whom the Gréeks called <hi>Dęmones,</hi> and of their office, <hi>diopous,</hi> that is to ſay <hi>orderers</hi> or <hi>ouerſeers</hi> and our men Angels and familiar Spirites. Wher-upon preuailed an opinion with all men, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vnto euery man immediatly after his birth is aſſigned of god a good Angell, which gouerneth his actions, helpeth him with ſecret ſuggeſtions of counſell and aduice, and to conclude) directeth all things to a good end
<pb facs="tcp:21193:26"/>and purpoſe. Many thinges there are extant in the olde writers, touching the familiar ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of <hi>Socrates</hi> &amp; likewiſe of <hi>Pythagoras.</hi> But how much this doctrine of <hi>Plato</hi> ſtrayeth from the trueth euery man though we holde our peace can iudge, if by none other matter, yet at leaſt by inducing the pluralitie of Gods.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 I come now to thoſe that haue imbraced our religion, whom alſo it is euident to haue iudged of prouidence not after one and the ſelfeſame manner.

For albeit they graunt the whole worlde with al and ſingular the partes therof to be by a generall motion ſtirred and gouerned of God: Yet notwithſtanding they attribute vnto euery creature his peculiar ſtrength and libertie in certaine actions, as though that euery one were not peculiarly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned and directed of God. They acknowle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>g that all creatures are moued at haphazard, and that man is caried whither ſoeuer he luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth after the libertie of his owne will: No o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then if God ſhould haue a ſufficient ſhare giuen him, in that he formed in his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures certaine organs or inſtrumentes (of
<pb facs="tcp:21193:27"/>which ſorte in man are the minde, reaſon, will, and ſuch like powers) which in déede might according to the inclination of their nature take the beginning of their moouing from God: but further Gods power might not ſtretch it ſelfe. Therefore this proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they called vniuerſall, wherein truelye the power of God dooth trimlye appeere you<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red abroad into all creatures, but not by a continuall diſpenſation and adminiſtration. And they were moued thus to determine, by a deſire they had of preſeruing the libertie of mans will ſo greatly praiſed and commended of many: and further, becauſe they would by this meanes auoide an inconuenience, to witte, leaſt God ſhould be counted the author of ſinne in men. for which cauſes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and the ſame great learned men haue vnto theſe thinges giuen their conſent.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 Some againe haue confeſſed that all the actions of men whatſouer are eſpeciallye go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned of God, but yet onely of the godly ſort, and ſo far foorth as they labour to a good end. Theſe, in aſmuch as their purpoſe is holy, they ſay, are diligently holpen of God, ſo as they may accompliſh that which they haue concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in their minde, and that God turneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way whatſoeuer might he a let or hinderance
<pb facs="tcp:21193:27"/>vnto them. In which reſpect God promiſed in the olde teſtament that he would be a God eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially vnto ſome, that is to ſay, their gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, patron and defender. But this opinion ſéemeth to detract the praiſe of goodnes from God, as though he were not alike deſirous of the ſaluation of all men, or as though he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured ſome, and enuied other ſome, beſides it diminiſheth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of God, as if he were not able to induce euill men vnto goodnes, or to vſe them to the perfourmance of ſome good thing: to conclude, it ſéemeth to ſlaunder God with the note of iniuſtice, as though for ſooth he dealt not vprightly, in that he leaueth ſometimes the wicked to their owne peruerſe will, and withdraweth his helping hand from them.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Wherfore now we will reckon vp the laſt opinion, which we our ſelues alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, and deſire to be receiued of all men. That is this, that Gods prouidence gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the worlde and all the things therin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned, and that truely in ſuch ſort, as by an appointed order he adminiſtreth euery thing, yea euen thoſe that are eſteemed leaſt, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo directeth the actions of euery thing to their appointed end. Wherupon we name it the ſpeciall or peculiar prouidence of God, and we
<pb facs="tcp:21193:28"/>auouch it ſo much the more diligently, by how much it is more cléerey inculked in euery leafe of the holy Scripture: by how much alſo it is more applied to illuſtrate and ſet foorth the power, goodnes, and righteouſnes of God: and to be ſhort by how much it bringeth more weight and importance to the comforting and confirming of our mindes in all doubtes, ſtreightes and dangers. For why? I ſuppoſe no man can in ſuch ſort be afflicted with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, but that he may by this knowledge of the particular prouidence of God, abundantlye reape and receiue, wherewith to ſatiffie his wayward and vnquiet conſcience, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to repreſſe all the aſſaults and occaſions of impacience.</p>
                     <p>And albe it we haue before, where we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined prouidence, ſhewed it after a ſort to be ſuch, yet ſeemeth it good ſtill to confirme the ſame with many &amp; more euident arguments. And firſt forſooth the waightieſt teſtimonies were to be drawen out of the Scriptures: but becauſe we haue before ſet downe not a fewe, wherby we haue prooued and made plain, that God hath a ſpeciall care of all mens matters and actions belonging as wel to the minde as body, ſo farre foorth that he guideth, moueth and aduaunceth, the iudgementes, willes, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes,
<pb facs="tcp:21193:28"/>and endeuours of men, whither they be good or euill, vnto what parte or purpoſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it pleaſeth him: wherby moreouer we haue declared, that euen thoſe thinges that are farre beneath the ſtate and condition of men, as moſt vile and abiect creatures, are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by Gods diſpenſation and ordinarye aſſignement, not only in generall, but alſo in particular: it is not néedfull we ſhould ſpend the time either in repeating of them, or in ſearching out of new. Onely this I will ſay, that it is meruailous, how in ſo great light of the Scripture ſome ſhould be ſo blinde, as not to ſee Gods peculiar prouidence, or being ſéene not to acknowledge it.

But now if after the fruition of ſo great care and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they wil not become better, nor acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the trueth, yet he leaueth them not ſo for all that: but for as much as they haue willinglye depriued themſelues of the participation of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life, he yet at the leaſt giueth vnto them all the benefites of this life, making his Sunne to ſhine vpon the good and vpon the euill, and rayning vpon the iuſt and vniuſt, yea and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring other thinges that belong to the courſe of this preſent life.

Neither is there cauſe why any man ſhould alleadg, that theſe thinges ought to be conſidered as miraculous and more then ordinarye, when as all theſe thinges doo teach and enſtruct vs alſo aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly touching the ordinarye diſpenſation of God, and further doo moſt grauely admoniſhe vs, that in all our actions which we take in hand, we ſhould alwaies haue the Maieſtie and power of Gods prouidence before our eyes. What ſhall we ſay to this that we read euen the elect alſo to haue beene ſtayed from their godly purpoſe, and that by the Lord him ſelfe? <hi>Paule</hi> had oftentimes purpoſed to viſite the <hi>Romanes.</hi> and was letted. <hi>Rom. <hi>1.</hi>
                        </hi> The ſame. <hi>Act. <hi>16</hi>
                        </hi> prepared with his companions to goe into <hi>Bithynia,</hi> but he was not ſuffered by the ſpirite. And for the ſame cauſe <hi>Iames</hi> in the <hi>4.</hi> Chap. of his Epiſtle dooth wiſely teach vs in all our attemptes and purpoſes, to ſay, <hi>If the Lord will.</hi> To conclude, neither in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual or internall actions, neither in corporal or external, neither in mean or middle can we doo any thing at all, but ſo farre foorth as the Lord by his prouidence dooth gouerne and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect vs.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:21193:36"/>
                     <p>What then? are we able to doo nothing by our owne will? nothing by our owne choyce? Yes, I graunt. Man hath his choice, in man there is a will, as in him alſo there is reaſon and iudgement. For who would goe about to take theſe thinges from him, when as the Scriptures alſo doo propound many thinges touching the will of man, wherby he turneth him ſelfe one while this way, another while that way? But the matter commeth to this point, that choyce and will of his is very ſore wounded, weake and féeble, ſo as it ſcarce de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth ſo much as the bare name, neither can it procéed further in dooing of any thing, then the Lorde preſcribeth. Thus then woorketh Gods prouidence, and withall woorketh mans will. If the prouidence of God hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned any thing to be doon by man, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is mans will alſo caried to the ſelfeſame thing, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf wholy vnto it, and waighting vpon it, no otherwiſe then the horſſe, who as the rider turneth the bridle, ſo dooth he turne him ſelfe into this or that way. Which ſimilitude <hi>Auguſtine</hi> alſo vſed, and in my iudgement ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry aptly. For like as the Rider in very déede ruleth the horſſe, and neuertheleſſe the horſſe is he that goeth forward by his own motion: euen ſo God directeth man alſo, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb facs="tcp:21193:37"/>the later man dooth of his owne will, that which he doth. For why it followeth not, that becauſe the Lord ruleth and moderateth the actions, therfore man woorketh not of his owne will: for indeed the very will woorketh together with Gods prouidence, yea and ſuch a will is brought foorth, as the Lord ordayned before ſhould be. Howbeit in the meane time the will or choice dooth not euery where and after the ſame maner confirm it ſelf to Gods prouidence. For although it be true, that the will by a certaine neceſſitie dooth ſerue the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine prouidence, yet dooth it not ſerue it by compulſion: which if we would wiſely diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh from neceſſitie, many offences and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies might eaſily be taken away: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which thing <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath ſaid ſome what in his <hi>3.</hi> book and <hi>4.</hi> Chap. of <hi>Free-will.</hi> When therfore Gods prouidence ordaineth good to be doon by vs, then hath the wil it ſelfe alſo reſpect vnto good, and is after a ſorte in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined therunto, ſo long as by the ſtirring of the holy Ghoſt (of whome alſo it is ſecretlye certified, of the diuine ordinance) it receiueth ſtrength, and proceedeth to the woork, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſheth it: albeit at the firſt the will dooth hardly agree, and for a time deuiſeth waies, how it may kick againſt it. But where the
<pb facs="tcp:21193:37"/>Lord ordaineth not good to be doon, there the will likewiſe is eſtranged from good, and (as it is alwaies prone vnto euill: <hi>Gene. 8.</hi>) ſo it runneth fréely to that which is naught, yea and feeling (as it were) the bridle ſomewhat looſe, it enterpriſeth ſomthing which it ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to be in it owne power, and ſo obeying corrupt affections by little and litle executeth euill according to it own deſire. Hitherto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long all the places, wherby it is ſignified, that the Lord him ſelfe dooth harden, <hi>Exod. 4.7.10.11.14. Rom. 9. Deut. 2. Eſa. 63. Iohn. 12.</hi> out of <hi>Eſay. 6.</hi> maketh blind, giueth or taketh away the hart, giueth the ſpirite of ſlomber, <hi>Rom. 11.</hi> out of <hi>Eſay. 6.</hi> deliuereth into a reprobate ſence, <hi>Rom. 1.</hi> leadeth into temptation: again the places wherin is declared, that men alſo doo aggrauate and harden their owne hartes, that they will not ſee, that they will not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. As in <hi>Exodus</hi> it is often repeated, that the Lord hardened <hi>Pharaos</hi> hart, and by and by alſo is added the like thing of <hi>Pharao</hi> him ſelfe. <hi>Pharao <hi>returned</hi>
                        </hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and went againe into his houſe, neither did he ſet his hart at all vnto this thing. <hi>Exod. 7.</hi>
                        </hi> But more cléer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the <hi>8.</hi> of <hi>Exod. Pharao <hi>ſeeing that he had reſpit giuen him, hardened his hart and would not heare them.</hi>
                        </hi> Which woordes béeing there
<pb facs="tcp:21193:38"/>and in the <hi>9.</hi> Chap. repeated, are very woorthy to be obſerued.</p>
                     <p>So alſo <hi>Eſa. 50. <hi>The Lord God opened mine eare, and I was not rebellious, neither tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned I back.</hi> Iohn. 1. <hi>As many as receiued him, to them he gaue power to be the ſonnes of God, euen to them that beleeue in his name.</hi> Iohn. 7 <hi>If a man wil obay his wil, that man ſhall know of his doctrine.</hi> Math. 23. Hieruſalem, Hieruſalem, <hi>how often would I haue gathered thy children together, euen as the Henne gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth her Chickens vnder her winges, and thou wouldſt not?</hi> Act. 13. <hi>So many beleeued as were ordeined to eternall life, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therfore not to tarry vpon many places, we are by Gods prouidence lead or drawen to all kinde of actions whatſoeuer, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe there remaineth a certaine choice or will in vs, which conformeth it ſelfe to the diuine prouidence, and is obedient euen of neceſſitie (to wit becauſe it is neceſſarye that that ſhould be perfourmed which god hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed) and yet not by compulſion: ſo as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if it be holpen by the holy ghoſte, it incly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vnto good: but if it be not holpen, it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vnto euill, wherunto it is of it ſelf prone and ready. And ſo ſtandeth faſt (after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> minde of the ſcripture) Gods particular prouidence,
<pb facs="tcp:21193:38"/>buſily occupied in and about all and ſingular the actions of men: ſo alſo ſtandeth faſt mans choice or will, is not in all reſpectes bond, ſo not in all reſpectes ſound or frée. To this effect hath <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſome thinges in his <hi>2.</hi> book and <hi>2.3.4.</hi> Chap. of <hi>Free-will.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now this doctrine is profitable, not onlye to put vs in minde, that ſo ofte as we take in hand to doo any thing, we ſhould looke for all power and ſucceſſe of our dooing from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord: but alſo that we ſhould enter into a more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent account, to conforme our will to Gods will, and alwaies to be carefull, to imbrace that which is good and acceptable vnto God. And this that it may y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better come to paſſe, we muſt pray continually vnto the Lord with the Prophet, ſaying: <hi>Incline my hart, o Lord, vnto thy teſtimonies, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Where in the ſecond place it was obiected againſt particular prouidence, that namely it ſhould ſeeme thereby to follow, that God is the author of ſinne, and that the euill which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted by man, is to be imputed vnto God, that matter now we haue to conſider off.</p>
                     <p>It cannot be denied, but that this one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath great force in it to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> abandoning of particular prouidence. And who is he that would not tremble and quake to allow of any
<pb facs="tcp:21193:39"/>thing (though but in outward ſhewe) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it might appéere that the diuine goodnes ſhould be diminiſhed, and the glorye of God neuer ſo little defaced? But defaced it muſt néedes be, if we ſay that he which is the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne good, and that neither will nor can doo any thing but good, dooth now degenerate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> goodnes, &amp; becommeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> author of ſinne. And ſurely by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> aſſertion of particuler prouidence, and by thoſe places which we laſtlye touched to th'eſtabliſhing of it, expreſly declaring that God hardeneth, blindeth, giueth the ſpirite of ſlumber, deliuereth into a reprobate ſence, lea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth into temptation, &amp;c. It ſeemeth moſt cleerely that ſo much is graunted, and mans reaſon dooth efteſoones héerupon, catch matter of cauilling. If it be God, ſaith it, that harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and maketh blinde, what man is he that can reſiſt Gods will? how may be withdrawe him ſelfe from that, vnto the which the Lord by his ordinance dooth (as ye would ſay) thruſt him forward? But if in caſe a man cannot chuſe but doo that which the Lord hath preor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to be doone by him, it muſt needes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that he ſinneth by the wil of God. Which if it be graunted, then cannot he be called to accompte, or pleaded guiltie, and much leſſe be ſubiect to any paines or puniſhments for
<pb facs="tcp:21193:39"/>the doing of it. For to lay puniſhement vpon ſuch a one, is eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as much an effect as to draw the innocent into danger, to rage againſt the guiltleſſe, yea and to oppoſe him ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ordinance and will of God. Theſe thinges therfore leaſt to the great and intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable offence of many they ſhould be vttered and miniſter occaſion to the wicked to take carnall libertie, and to excuſe their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſenes in the ſinnes which they dayly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte, it is very requiſite to proue, that God is by no meanes the author or cauſe of ſinne.</p>
                     <p>But how and after what ſorte this may be doone, it is not ſo eaſie a matter to diſcuſſe, and eſpeciallye becauſe the places of Scripture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rehearſed doo put vs to ſome buſines. As coueting therfore to auoide ſo many inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences as doo ſeeme heeruppon to followe, firſt ſome haue preſumed to deminiſh Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in ſaying that God dooth by no meanes regarde theſe inferior thinges: for it were a very vnſéemely thing, that ſo great a Maieſty ſhould be entangled with our ſinnes and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannes. For which cauſe alſo they haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uized Chaunce-medley or haphazard, wherof we will ſpeake alſo in fitte place. Otherſome haue thought this courſe to be beſt, namely, to extol mans will and to make the ſame moſt
<pb facs="tcp:21193:40"/>franke and frée, dooing and perfourming with full power and authority, not only euill things but alſo good, ſo as it may deſerue euen eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life by it owne proper force and ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>And therfore that the cauſes of all actions ought vnto this moſt franke and free will to be aſcribed. But with theſe men we think it not good to diſpute any further, ſeeing we haue ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently declared, both that all theſe thinges here belowe are cared for of God, and alſo how farre foorth our will is able to woorke or doo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing whatſoeuer. Now otherſome more religious then the former haue ſought out o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther helpes, and ſome of them haue referred all thoſe places, (wherby it ſeemeth to be me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that God dooth woorke together vnto ſinne) vnto foreknowledge, ſaying, that God indeed foreſaw and foreknew that men would ſinne, but prouided not, that is to ſaye, diſpoſed by his incomprehenſible counſell, that ſuch acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould be doone by men. And ſo ſeeing foreknowledge alone dooth woorke nothing at all to the committing of ſinne, neither by any meanes enforce it, they thinke that God is aboundantlye excuſed, and farre from béeing the cauſe of any ſinne. Some liked better to vſe a diſtinction, whereby they determine ſome thinges to be doone ſimplye by the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb facs="tcp:21193:40"/>will of God, and ſome thinges onlye by his permiſſion, and wincking at them (if it be lawfull ſo to ſpeake.) After the opinion of theſe men, when it is ſaide that God harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Pharaos</hi> hart, the <hi>Hebrue</hi> phraſe is ſo to be expounded, as that the ſence ſhould be, that <hi>Pharao</hi> was in déed hardened not by the effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall will of God, but only by his permiſſion and ſufferance. And as permiſſion hath no blame in it ſelfe, eſpeciallye where it is not bound of duety to let euill, ſo that the cauſe of ſinne can by no meanes be laid vpon God. And this reaſon hath preuailed with a great number. But if in caſe we conſider well of the matter, we ſhall perceiue that theſe interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations as they be farre fetcht, ſo are they neither neceſſary, neither can they very well hang togither for as touching foreknowledge firſt by this reaſon the force of prouidence is excluded from many thinges, and is pent vp in too narrowe a roome. Secondlye there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth yet ſomething, for which God may by wicked reaſon be accuſed and found fault with. For if God hath foreſeene euill, and not letted it (ſith it was in his power to doo it) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath he not doone wel, inſomuch as he preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not that in time, which he foreſaw ſhould come to paſſe. And ſo is God againe made the
<pb facs="tcp:21193:41"/>author of ſinne. For permiſſion dooth attribut ſuch an inlenes in a maner vnto God, as <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus</hi> dreamed off. Certes it would be a thing not very ſéemelye or commendable in God, when a man attempteth to doo any thing by his own naturall inclination, to diſſemble the matter in ſuch ſorte, as to ſuffer him to runne headlong into perdition and deſtruction. For what father could abide to ſée his little childe neere vnto ſome certaine danger, and would not by and by helpe him and pluck him from it: Further it is an abſurd thing, that God ſhould permit any thing which he would not haue to be doon, as who ſhould ſay, that any thing could come to paſſe without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or againſt his will. And how ſhall we knowe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God permitteth a thing, but becauſe he willeth it? How much more truely the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may we ſay, that God dooth ſimplye will a thing, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> permit or ſuffer it? I know there be ſome that defend this interpretation of permiſſion by bringing forth certain places of Scripture, as namely theſe. <hi>Act. 14. <hi>God in times paſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred al the Gentils to walk in their own waies. Againe</hi> Pſal. 81. <hi>My people would not hear my voyce, and</hi> Iſraell <hi>would none of me. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I gaue them vp into the hardnes of their hart, that they might walke in their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</hi>
                           <pb facs="tcp:21193:41"/>1. Corinth. 10. <hi>God is faithfull, which will not ſuffer you to be te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted aboue your ſtrength</hi>
                        </hi> But héereby it is not meant, that God dooth generally giue ouer vnto themſelues, all that are about to fall into ſinne, but rather that he dooth then in déede ſometimes forſake the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and ſuffer them to perriſh with their own deuiſes, when after ſundry and often admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they will not be brought to repent: or that he doth now &amp; then leaue euen the godly alſo to the deuill for a time to be tryed with diuers troubles and temptations. Which thing that it commeth to paſſe by the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar prouidence of God, and by his iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is in it ſelfe cléere and manifeſt. And theſe thinges are ſo farre off from béeing doon without the determination of Gods wiſdom, that euen the ſingular prouidence of God doth ſhine &amp; ſhew foorth it ſelf in them. Moreouer, ſith theſe places are very fewe in compariſon which ſeeme to allowe permiſſion, it were a very vnméete thing, to wreſt innumerable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places (wherin is cleerelye and without ambiguitie aſcribed vnto God his woorke in the hartes and willes of men) and (in ſteed of diſcouering the natiue ſence and meaning) to drawe them with violence into the compaſſe of thoſe places.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:21193:42"/>
                     <p>Wherfore we muſt ſtick faſt to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plaine and ſimple meaninge of the holy Scriptures, and holde faſt the true and naturall ſignification of the woordes, auouching for a certaintie that God dooth all in all, not by permiſſion or ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but by his ordinary diſpenſation and prouidence: that is to ſay, that he dooth truly and by his determinate purpoſe harden, make blinde, giue vp into a reprobate ſence, leade into temptation, and euery other thinge like vnto theſe. Such phraſes of ſpéeche are more oftner found in the Scriptures, then that any other way of expounding them is raſhly to be deuiſed: which thinge <hi>Auguſtine</hi> alſo noted in his fifth booke and third Chapter againſt <hi>Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus.</hi> And yet for all this it followeth not héer by, that the ſinnes of men ſo by God hardned, blinded &amp;c are to be imputed vnto him. Which poynte wée by certaine ſubſtauntiall reaſones will make plaine and manifeſt.</p>
                     <p>Firſt: Although it be God that dooth moue and incline the hart either vnto good or euill, yet there remaineth in man, as we haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpecified, a will, which is no doubt the ſin guler gift of God beſtowed vpon man. Now wheras man dooth ſhamefully abuſe this will of his, doutles he dooth it by his owns default. For whileſt by his owne will he adicteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb facs="tcp:21193:42"/>to the filthy affections of his corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, labouring with his whole harte after e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, &amp; therin not a little delighting himſelfe: in this caſe I ſay, whileſt he obayeth himſelfe rather then God (whome it would eſpecially pleaſe &amp; delight, if man would craue his ayde and holy ſpirite) who either will or may excuſe man ſo dooing, and lay the fault or blame vpon God? As touching this matter, we haue a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table example in <hi>Iudas,</hi> who albeit he were by Gods ordinance apointed to betray the ſonns of man, as Chriſt himſelfe dooth manifeſtly declare: yet notwithſtanding could he not ſo eſcape, but that the guilte and condemnation lighted vpon his owne head. For wheras he harkened vnto the deuill, prompting him to enterpriſe ſo hainous a facte, and he bent his whole will and ſtudy to accompliſh ſo horrible a treaſon, by going of his owne accorde to the aduerſaries the Préeſtes conſulting about the matter, by requiring a reward for his labour, by ſeeking occaſion and oportunity to commit that miſcheuous déede, in crauing the aide of armed ſoldiers to aſſiſt him, in preſcribing the time, place, manner and token vnto them, and finallye in deliuering him into their handes: Héerin vndoutedly he ſinned moſt gréeuouſly, and made him ſelfe guiltie of eternall damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:21193:43"/>euen Chriſt him ſelf alſo giuing teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny therof, when he ſaith: <hi>Woe vnto that man by whome the ſonne of man is betrayed: it had beene good for that man, if he had neuer been borne: <hi>Math. 26.</hi>
                        </hi> Whither belongeth alſo the confeſſion of <hi>Iudas</hi> him ſelf, ſaying: <hi>I haue ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen in betraying the innocent blood.</hi> So ought we to iudge in like maner of <hi>Peter,</hi> vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e the very ordinance of God was alſo made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by Chriſt, to wit, that he ſhould thrice deny him. Which thing he did, and that not ſimply, but by adding too of othes and curſings for ſo farre did the will put foorth it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>The ſame man beeing admoniſhed by the ſigne of the Cocke crowing, acknowledged his ſinne, and confeſſed him ſelfe guiltie, bewailing his offence with many teares. Therfore it is mans owne wil and not Gods ordinance that maketh ſinners guiltie. Neither is there any cauſe why a new action ſhould be commenſed againſt God, as though he were to be blamed in this, that he gaue vnto man a will, which he foreknew he would abuſe. For why? albeit he fore-knewe that he would abuſe it, yet he gaue it not to this end that he ſhould abuſe it, and beſides he gaue (at what time man was firſt created) a moſte noble freedome of will, wherby he might (if he had liſted) euen by his
<pb facs="tcp:21193:43"/>owne ſtrength and power, rightly haue vſed his will. Yea &amp; God foreſéeing that he would abuſe if, foreſaw withall by what meanes he might raiſe him vp againe beeing falne, and how by dooing of it he might illuſtrate and ſet foorth his power and goodnes. And whileſt he is occupied in the execution héerof, he cannot be iudged to deale otherwiſe then iuſtlye and well. Wherfore alſo when God prouideth that any man ſhall fall, he dooth wel notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, inaſmuch as he diſpoſeth al thinges by his certaine and profitable counſell: but in the meane ſeaſon, becauſe man committeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, not in reſpect of Gods prouidence, and as one executing the will of God, and deſiring to honor God by that meanes, but rather to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie his owne will and pleaſure, therfore (I ſay) is God exempted from all ſpot of blame, and man only found guilty of ſinne.</p>
                     <p>Secondly: It ſeemeth that this alſo may not be ſaide amiſſe, that like as Gods fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge is not deceiued, ſo neither in like maner can his prouidence be deceiued. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it commeth to paſſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God dooth prouide and ordaine ſuch thinges, as vnto the which he foreknoweth mans will (ſo farre foorth as in him lyeth) to be moſt vehemently inclyned and diſpozed. But ſith God is in no wiſe ſo
<pb facs="tcp:21193:44"/>bound vnto man, as that he ſhould let his wil, and drawe it perforce (ſtriuing to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) vnto good: he is not to be accuſed or found fault with, in that he leaueth him to his own counſell, and permitteth him to fulfil his own peruerſe will, which he foreknew would ſo come to paſſe. But if ſo be a man will ſtil rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the matter with god, and ſay, that he doth not ſufficiently regard man his creature, and for that cauſe thinke him woorthy to be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of neglecting his mercy, euen héere it may be anſwered, that God dooth by this meanes ſhew foorth his iuſtice, wherof he is to haue no leſſe conſideration the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his mercy. For God dealeth vprightly, whilſte he leueth euen him that is voide of all actuall ſinne, in thoſe dregs of vncleannes wherin he is borne. Neither hath man any thing in him ſelfe, for which he is woorthy to be holpen.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly: Albeit God &amp; man doo put their handes hoth together to one and the ſelfſame thing, yet becauſe God dooth it far otherwiſe and to a far other end then man, it commeth to paſſe that man therfore is taken tardy, and God frée from all blame, yea, he procureth to himſelfe therby, praiſe and glory. God woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and ordaineth ſome notable wicked men to eſcape all danger for a time, which perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
<pb facs="tcp:21193:44"/>the Godly, and exerciſe all maner of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie againſt them: but he dooth it to the end he may make afterward as wel his power, as his goodnes and iuſtice to become the more glorious: his power (I ſay) and goodnes, in the wonderfull deliuering of them afterward whom they afflicted: and his iuſtice, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying eftſoones the wicked tirants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Againe ſuch men woorke, but bending all their will and endeuour vnto euil, and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly hardening their owne hartes, to the intent they may euery way, againſt all right and equitie oppreſſe the godly and innocent. An example of this thing we haue in <hi>Pharao,</hi> whom God ſtirred vp to this end and purpoſe, as it is ſaide. <hi>Rom. <hi>9. that he might ſhewe in him his power, and that his name might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in all the earth.</hi>
                        </hi> And of <hi>Pharao</hi> we heare euery where in <hi>Exodus,</hi> that he hardened his owne hart, that he fought diuers waies to hinder the people of God, &amp;c. Neither is that much vnlike vnto this which we finde repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Kings of <hi>Babilon,</hi> whom God in like maner ſtirred vp as his inſtruments to puniſh the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> but they in the meane time ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled their own luſt in their tirannious enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes, &amp; did many thinges in deſpight of God for which cauſe alſo they were by him ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb facs="tcp:21193:45"/>and ouerthrowne. It would be ouer long to recite all the examples that tend to this purpoſe. And this is a certaine trueth, that God, as he dooth faſhion, ſanctifie, and prepare ſome, euen in their mothers wombe, to the execution of ſome notable exploites, like as we réed of <hi>Iacob, Ieremy</hi> and <hi>Iohn Baptiſt:</hi> ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he prepareth otherſome to other woorkes, and ſtirreth vp their willes afterward, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that which is appointed them to door but all to good and profitable ends, which they look not after, and which mans vnderſtanding cannot attaine vnto, further foorth then they are expreſſed in the Scriptures. So <hi>Eſau,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was borne, was hated of the Lord, and by him ordained to forgoe the bleſſing. Likewiſe God woorketh, and ſome he caſteth vp ſometimes into a reprobate minde: but in in this pointe whileſt he puniſheth their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer mallice, wherby they wold not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the trueth offered, or béeing knowen would néedes ſet it at naught, nay violentlye oppreſſe it, certes in this caſe he deſerueth the praiſe and commendation of iuſtice. Againe on the other ſide, ſuch men woork, but heaping one ſinne vpon an other, and gréeuing continually the ſpirit of God by their obſtinacie in euil doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Touching this woork of God, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb facs="tcp:21193:45"/>of euill men, it is thus written <hi>Rom. 1. <hi>Therfore becauſe that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankfull, &amp;c. God alſo gaue them vp to their owne hartes luſtes, vnto vncleannes, to defile their owne bodies betweene themſelues, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </hi> Where is to be obſerued this particle, <hi>to their owne hartes luſt,</hi> becauſe therby is noted the proper mallice of thoſe men, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which they are worthely blamed. <hi>Rom. 11.</hi> out of <hi>Eſa. 6. <hi>God hath giuen them the ſpirit of ſlumber: eies that they ſhould not ſee, and eares that they ſhould not heare vnto this day.</hi> 2. Theſ. 2. <hi>The comming of that man of ſinne, is with all decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uablenes of vnrighteouſnes among them that perriſhe, becauſe they receiued not the loue of the trueth that they might be ſaued. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God ſhall ſende them ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhould beleeue lyes, that al they might be damned which beleeued not the trueth, but had pleaſure in vnrighteouſnes.</hi>
                        </hi> To be ſhort, God woorketh, but yet ſo as he tickeleth the minde of him whom he moueth, to the intent that ſo ſoone as he perceiueth himſelfe to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way prouoked vnto euill, he may haue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to acknowledge his owne weaknes, to craue and call for Gods help, and (at a woord) to beléeue vndoubtedly that he ſhall obtayne
<pb facs="tcp:21193:46"/>it. So <hi>Paule,</hi> when there was giuen vnto him a prick in the fleſhe, the meſſenger of Sathan to buffet him, <hi>2. Corinth. 12.</hi> he tooke occaſion thereby to pray often: and when he obtayned not the ſame to be taken from him, he was taught thereby that it was ſent vnto him for his great profit, to wit, that he ſhould not be exalted out of meaſure through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> abundance of reuelations. God woorketh, but yet mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, and leaſt a man ſhould be tempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue his ſtrength, that ſo he may be holpen in due time. God worketh, but ſo as he may the more gloriouſly lift him vp that is fowly falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, heale him that is wounded, and exalte him that is humbled. God woorketh in the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Iob. 1.</hi> and in <hi>Semei, 2. Sam. 16.</hi> but it was to proue the manifolde ſtrength as well of <hi>Iob</hi> as of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and that dooth both <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> confeſſe, the one ſaying, <hi>I he Lord hath giuen, and the Lord hath taken away,</hi> the other forbidding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> partie to be hindred, and expreſly adding, <hi>That the Lord had giuen <hi>Semer</hi> in charge, ſo to curſſe and blaſpheme.</hi> God woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in the théef &amp; man ſlayer, but it is to the intent to deliuer the partie wrongfully trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled or ſlaine out of far greater miſeries, and to tranſlate him into eternall life: to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent alſo that the Prince or Judge may haue
<pb facs="tcp:21193:46"/>iuſt matter and occaſion to puniſh the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor with due paines and penalties of lawe, that many of the common people which haue not offended in like ſort, may take example by him that is puniſhed, to beware of the like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities: to conclude, for other good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable cauſes, which all we in no wiſe are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſcuſſe. In ſumme, God dooth all in all euen in euill and wicked men, yet iuſtly and to a good end. But the thinges that in theſe ſelfe ſame actions are comnitted of men, or els of the deuill (for that we may note this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by the way, it is not abſurde, if we ſay that God, men, and the Deuill doo woorke togither to one and the ſelfe ſame thing: which thing is to be ſeen in the betraying of Chriſt, where the Lord had appointed it ſo to be, then Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than entred into the hart of <hi>Iudas,</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> wayting his opportunity committed the déed, likewiſe in <hi>Iob,</hi> where the Lord woorketh, then next Sathan and the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> doo egregiou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly play their partes: wherby it commeth to paſſe, that as God is ſaide to harden, ſo is the ſame power attributed vnto man to wit, that he hardeneth himſelfe. <hi>Pſal. 94. <hi>Harden not your hartes.</hi>
                        </hi> and againe the deuill is ſaide to <hi>woork in the vnbelleuers, <hi>2. Corinth. 4. Epheſ. 2</hi>
                        </hi> whither we haue reſpect to the manner, or to
<pb facs="tcp:21193:47"/>the ende, doo ſauour of nothing els but euill, they tend to no other purpoſe then euill, and they doo all thinges euery where (if not open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet at the leaſt priuily) againſt the glory of God and againſt the profit of their neighbour Which thinges ſeeing they ſtand thus, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the blame and blemiſhe of all euill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth vpon man and the deuill: and God dooth euermore retaine and keepe the praiſe of iuſtice, goodnes, power, and other ſuch like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent vertues. And howſoeuer God woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in theſe matters, yet hath man no iuſt cauſe of mourning, neither can he pretend the iuſt and good ordinance of God to couer his owne mallice and vnrighteouſnes. To this point we muſt of neceſſitie come at the length and confeſſe, that becauſe God ſo willeth, and becauſe he willeth nothing but good, therfore he cannot deale or woork otherwiſe then well. Hence is that <hi>Rom. 9. <hi>Why dooth he yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain? For who hath reſiſted his wil? But, o man, who art thou, that pleadeſt with God? Shal the pot ſay to the potter, why haſt thou made me of this faſhion? &amp;c.</hi>
                        </hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly: Sinne can in no wiſe be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto God, but it is imputed vnto man: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe god is ſubiect to no lawes againſt which he might be conuicted to offend: but vnto man
<pb facs="tcp:21193:47"/>ther is a law alwaies preſcribed by the which he is reproued of ſinne and brought to the knowledge of ſinne. And ſo, although God be after his manner author of the woorke, yet is he not author of the ſinne. Now then it is a very eaſie matter to anſwere to the other cauillations, as namely, wherfore man ſhould be puniſhed, and drawne (as it were) to the place of execution. Doubtleſſe ſeeing be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth euill of his owne will, ſéeing that as well all the matter of euill is found to be in him, as alſo that he hath reſpect to an euill end in his actions, and ſéeing alſo that he tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſeth the law preſcribed vnto him: worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye is he drawne before the Judge (beeing the miniſter of Gods iuſtice, and the inſtruement ordained of God for the preſeruation of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique peace in the fellowſhip and ſocietie of men) who is to puniſh him according to the qualitie of his offence. And thus much for the ſecond obiection againſt pecultar or particular prouidence may ſuffize.</p>
                     <p>In the third place we are to entreate of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary cauſes, which it appéereth to be all cleane wiped away, if euery of theſe inferiour thinges héere belowe be doone and diſpatched by the wil and prouidence of God himſelf: and yet that they ſhould be remoued out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way,
<pb facs="tcp:21193:48"/>neither is it a thing vſuall, neither dooth any reaſon permit or ſuffer them ſo to be. We anſwer e bréefely that as touching ſecondarye cauſes, which are otherwiſe called inferiour cauſes, we will ſet them in their right place: but according as both the manner of the woord and the nature of the relation dooth require, we muſt of neceſſite reduce them to an other firſt and higher cauſe, which is God himſelfe, ſo that, albeit they may ſeeme to woorke and ſerue to our vſe, yet we muſt vnderſtand that they cannot doo or effect any thing, but ſo farre foorth as they receiue and participate their whole force from the firſt cauſe, which alone and in very déede obtaineth of right the name of cauſe. (Wherupon alſo it hath pleaſed ſome to terme it the cauſe infinite, and cauſe of all cauſes.) For as the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer of it ſelf can in no wiſe make in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iron any certain print or faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Key, ſawe, or ſuch like thing, vnles the Smith him ſelfe doo put both the hammer and the iron to the Anuile and ofte times ſtrike v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it: ſo muſt we perſwade our ſelues, that neither in the ſecond cauſes efficient, nor in the thinges hoped to be effected by them, any thing can follow or be brought to perfection, except God him ſelfe dooth ſtirre vp, temper, and bring al things to their right and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:21193:48"/>end. And looke what accompt we make of tooles or inſtrumentes, which we vſe to apply to the woorkmanſhip and making of any thing whatſoeuer: and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſelfe ſame regarde is to be had with God of ſecond or ſecondary cauſes, (as we call them.) For why the inſtruments of themſelues are nothing els then idle and vnprofitable, and ſcarce woorthy (if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them well) the name of cauſes: vnleſſe peraduenture as the hanuner or ſaw may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſort be called cauſes, which yet are not ſo to be taken for cauſes, as if a table or forme or any ſuch like thing be wel &amp; artificially made, any praiſe or reward ſhould returne vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the which all men doo know that they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can woorke or are able to doo any thing, but what and how much the crafteſman him ſelfe will haue or cauſe them to doo. And ſo are we to iudge of all other thinges. For take me an hearbe alſo or any other like thing that is good for phiſick, &amp; albeit it may ſéem to haue eſpecial vertue againſt ſome certaine kinde of diſeaſe, and béeing vſed may peraduenture helpe the ſick partie, yet in very deede it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe by the woorkmanſhip of God, who dooth woork effectually by the hearb. For proofe héereof this may ſerue, that the ſame hearbe otherwiſe heeing applyed, vnto ſome
<pb facs="tcp:21193:49"/>other that is infected with the like diſeaſe, dooth no good to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> curing of it: and whence commeth this, but becauſe the Lord there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth to woork by it? So farre foorth is a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine neuer holeſomely applyed, but when it pleaſeth the Lord him ſelfe to woork with it. Wherupon alſo it commeth to paſſe, that oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a man recouereth his health, by that thing that he leaſt thought off, and all becauſe the Lord woorketh with it, howſoeuer other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it ſeemeth in no wiſe to be prepared for that vſe. So where the Lord Ieſus ſpitted v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ground, and made clay, and put it to the eyes of the blinde, that clay of it ſelfe did nothing toward the reſtoring of the ſight: for who euer vſed ſuch a medicine? but yet there it did good and preuailed, becauſe it pleaſed the Lord to adde his ſtrength to that outward ſigne. And in like manner we ſée other ofte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be healed, by taking this or that thing, which yet was neuer thought to haue any force or ſtrength in it againſt the preſent diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Therfore all ſecondary cauſes are in very déede only (as ye would ſay) certaine tooles or inſtrumentes, yet ſuch as are neuer forcible to woork, but when the Lord him ſelfe giueth ſtrength vnto them. But this is to be marked
<pb facs="tcp:21193:49"/>of vs, that ſecondary cauſes are not in euery<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> reſpect like vnto tooles: for theſe are ſuch, as without them the artificer can doo nothing. For why, except hee haue his hammer, ſawe, chip-axe, and ſuch like inſtrueme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to ceaſe, as neuer able with his fingers or nayles alone to heawe the timber, nor to plaine the boordes. But God for his part, can without the helpe of any ſecond cauſes, bring to paſſe at all times whatſoeuer it pleaſeth him. For hence it is, that ſo many thinges happen which we account for miracles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in them, whither it be the healing of the ſicke, or any other vnuſuall thinge be doone, we can ſée in no ſecond cauſes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre, as otherwiſe among men are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vſed. Hence likewiſe it is, that ſo many great thinges come to paſſe ſoddenly and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the expectation of men: as for example, when we ſee all thinges in a readines to war, and now the banners to be diſplaied, the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derds erected, and the battailes fully bent to ioyne togither, yet (beholde) no man once dreaming of any ſuch matter, peace is ſodenly proclaimed, the armes on either ſide diſmiſſed and ſent away, &amp;c. Againe on the other ſide, when there appeered moſt certaine hope of peace to be continued, euen then haue riſen
<pb facs="tcp:21193:50"/>vp, and no man knowing how or by whome, horrible ſtirres and tumultes. In all which thinges the only prouidence of God woorketh all in all, and that without the help of any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary cauſes appéering vnto vs.</p>
                     <p>Therfore what things ſoeuer come to paſſe throughout the whole worlde, it is certayne, that they are doone and accompliſhed by God him ſelfe: and if at any time ſecondary cauſes doo ſoeme to woorke any thing at all, yet are they nought els but vnprofitable tooles, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtrength, and of no force in them ſelues. And verily when God vſeth the miniſterie of them, he dooth it (doubtleſſe) more for our cauſe, then for his owne. For why, that he is able to bring to paſſe without them whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it pleaſeth him, there is no man that can deny. But for this cauſe his pleaſure is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to woorke by them, to wit, that his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine power woorking in thinges viſible, may put foorth it ſelfe the more cléerely to be ſeen and that we might be admoniſhed therby and driuen (as manifeſtlye conuicted) to confeſſe, that the deuine aide is diuers &amp; ſundry waies and at all times preſent with vs, and that there is nothing in the whole world ſo ſmall, or albeit, created in vaine, but that from eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that is, there floweth one commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb facs="tcp:21193:50"/>or other either vnto man, or vnto other thinges, according as the diuine prouidence of God hath appointed and ordained. For our ſakes therfore it is, that in ſecondary or infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior cauſes the force of Gods power and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes doth vtter and declare it ſelfe, and not for Gods cauſe him ſelfe, who dooth at no hand ſtand in néed of their aide or helpe. For like as when any péece of woorke cunningly and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially made is ſet foorth openlye to be ſeene, there the crafteſman him ſelfe is praiſed and commended of all the beholders, and not this or that toole or inſtruement which he vſed in making of it: ſo in all thinges that come to paſſe heere belowe, albeit they may ſéeme to be accompliſhed by ſecondary cauſes (as they are vſually tearmed) yet if there be any good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and excellency in them, the prouidence and goodnes of God him ſelfe ought eſpeciallye to be conſidered and commended, yea and al the praiſe and thankes giuing is to be aſcribed vnto God him ſelfe, and not vnto any ſecond or inferior cauſes. Wherefore we doo not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly graunt vnto ſecondary cauſes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> roome and authoritie which they deſerue: but in the mean ſeaſon this we would haue to be grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againe vnto vs, that whatſoeuer ſéemeth to be wrought or accompliſhed by them, may
<pb facs="tcp:21193:51"/>be aſcribed vnto God alone as to the chéefe and principall author: inaſmuch as they with out him can doo nothing, but contrariwiſe he without them is well able to doo all things. And thus is concluded that which was ſaide of vs at the beginning, namely that God doth all in all in euery thing, and that his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence neceſſarily ſtretcheth it ſelfe euen to the leaſt thinges that are brought to paſſe in this lower part of the worlde, and not ſimplye ſtretche if ſelfe vnto them, but alſo exactly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneth and adminiſtreth euery thing. But I thought good to ad heerunto certain woords of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> as touching ſecond or inferior cauſes, and touching the force of Gods power woorking in all thinges, for ſo much as they doo wonderouſlye well agrée to this preſent treatiſe of ours.

                     <p>Héereby it may appéere, how fond and ſhamefull the cauillations of ſome men are, wherby they goe about to ſubuert and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe particular prouidence.

Nay further God ſhall not be called vpon by praier, nor ſought vnto, to the intent we might obtaine any thing of him, when as we are ſure y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> nothing can come to paſſe, but that
<pb facs="tcp:21193:53"/>which he hath once decréed. In ſumme, it ſhall be ſufficient for a man once in all his life to commend him ſelfe wholy vnto God: and then with hault and bolde courage to look for whatſoeuer he ſhall ſend: for why in this caſe there remaineth nothing els for man to doo. With theſe and ſuch like cauils (I ſay) a ſort of ignorant men ſeeke to ſuppreſſe particular prouidence: but he ſhall eaſily ouerthrow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that will héedfullye conſider of thoſe thinges that haue hitherto of vs been ſaide. But ouer and beſides, we will adde certaine rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons cleere and manifeſt, whereby we will ſhewe, that euen ſecondary cauſes (when the cace ſo requireth) are in no wiſe to be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or neglected, and yet neuertheleſſe that God woorketh all in all in them.</p>
                     <p>Firſt: We muſt perſwade our ſelues, that thoſe cauſes and all other helpes and reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies beſides are giuen vs of God him ſelf: and look by what prouidence it is ordained, that we ſhould fall into dangers, and ſtand in need of many things, and by the ſame alſo it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, that we ſhould vſe ſecondary cauſes, and be holpen by them. For as it is ordayned of God, that we ſhould be pined with hunger, pinched with thirſt, frozen with colde, diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with diuers diſeaſes, and oftentimes fall
<pb facs="tcp:21193:53"/>into, ſundry perrilles and perplexities: ſo is it appointed again of God, that we ſhould ſowe and mowe our lands, prouide water or other kinds of drink, get ſkins, lether, linnen, &amp; wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len for apparel, giue diligence to learn phiſick.</p>
                     <p>Secondly: It ſerueth to this purpoſe, that God hath inſtilled into euery thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath created certaine ſecret and peculiar vertues, which we cannot perceiue in like maner to be in other things. So we ſée corn or grain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to qualifie hunger, water to que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch thirſt, this hearbe for this vſe, an other for that, &amp;c. in moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t order prouided. But all eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to ſerue the vſe of man, as Lord &amp; King appointed ouer al creatures: whoſe parte it is in ſuch wiſe to vſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he may apply eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing to thoſe ſpeciall purpoſes, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which they were properly made, and not out of one and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſelfe ſame thing to be in hope y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhall get all things: that is to ſay, that he ſhall not with meat goe about to quench his thirſt, nor take drink to ſlake his hunger, &amp;c. Now the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if euery thing be in this wiſe created vnto pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and peculiar vſes, what availeth it y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhould be ſo created, if a man vſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame ends &amp; purpoſes: Thirdly: this alſo is to be obſerued, as worthy of admiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, namly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ther is no land or cuntry any wher extant, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:21193:54"/>bringeth not foorth what ſoeuer thinges are neceſſary, to maintaine the life of men, and of other creatures, wherof there is greateſt vſe. Againe no liuing creature ſo ſmall, wherunto God hath not engraffed a care to preſerue it ſelfe, and alſo ſome ſence and féeling by one meanes or other to auoide the thinges that it ſeeeth to be againſt it. And wherefore is it thus (I pray you) but becauſe man ſhould vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that he is altogither left without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, if (as oft as neceſſitie ſo require) he vſe not the helpes that are prouided, and ſtriue not to helpe and further him ſelfe by them?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly: For the ſelfeſame cauſe hath God giuen vnto man wit and reaſon, wherby he might diſcerne betweene thinges to be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed and thinges to be deſired: he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon him the knowledge of many thinges, diuers and ſundry excellent artes, the obſeruation and experience of manifolde actes and exploites. Finally de hath miniſtred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man all neceſſary furniture, wherby to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure good thinges, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>e the contrary. Wherefore then ſhould he not (by applying the commoditie of thoſe ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ndarye cauſes to himſelfe) make vſe of theſe notable giftes of God?</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, It is to be obſerued, that God him
<pb facs="tcp:21193:54"/>ſelfe dooth oft times (when as ſtrange and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuſtomed perrilles <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ye and (as it were) by ſecret inſpiration mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter conuenient and rare, likewiſe ſtrange and vnaccuſtomed counſailes and inſtructions by which the worfull wight being almoſt paſt hope of recouery is yet ſtill deliuered and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. Which when it ſo falleth out, it is a plaine caſe that this is Gods will, that we ſhould vſe aright (and when néed is) ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cauſes, inaſmuch as he ordereth and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth them all at his pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly: This alſo is the cauſe, why God would haue man to be ignorant of thinges to come, and not priuie to his dinine counſels, namely that he béeing plunged in ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent perill, and not knowing what the iſſue of it will be, may learne to flye to the remedies prouided of God, and ſo in due time by ſaith to waite for Gods helpe effectuallye woorking in them.</p>
                     <p>Seuenthly: And thus forſooth will God haue man to haue recourſe vnto ſecond cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, wherin he him ſelfe woorketh, and which he hath appointed to certaine vſes for all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents and purpoſes, inſomuch that he accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him ſelfs to be tempted w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great reproche
<pb facs="tcp:21193:55"/>when a man in preſent perrill refuſeth to vſe ſuch proper and peculier remedies as are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and at hand for the nonce. So if thou run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt not away, when thou ſéeeſt thy houſe at the point to fall vpon thy head, (thou at leaſt wiſe being able, and God hauing giuen thée ſtrong legges and féete to that end) doubtleſſe thou makeſt thy ſelfe guilty of ſinne.</p>
                     <p>It is euident therfore, that ſecondary cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes (ſith they are ordained of God him ſelfe, and the neceſſitie of mans life requireth them) are in no wiſe to be neglected or deſpiſed: and yet in the mean time, not further foorth auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable, then it pleaſeth God him ſelfe to woork in them. And ſo we may ſee oftentimes, that being vſed in time they doo much good, as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one eſcapeth by flight, another is holpen by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of medicines, another defended by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and weapon, another obtaining his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire by praying vnto God, to be ſhort, ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eſcaping by ſome other means from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger either preſent or imminent, and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it pleaſeth the Lord to woorke together with thoſe ſecondary cauſes. Againe on the other ſide, we ſée oftetimes other to attempte all the like thinges, as namely to endeuer to ſaue themſelues by flight, to call for the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fition and carefullye to obey his preceptes, to
<pb facs="tcp:21193:55"/>take vp armour and weapon, to intreat God for his helpe, finally to leaue nothing vnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, and yet notwithſtanding to ſticke continuallye in daunger, and at the length miſerably to perriſhe: and that for no other cauſe, then for that the Lord dooth not put to his helping hand. Againe we may ſee ſome ſet in the middeſt of the flaming fire, compaſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout on euery ſide with the outeries and dead coarſes of ſick and diſeaſed perſons, beſet with naked ſwoordes flaſhing about their eares, and laſtly deſtitute of all outward helpe, and yet (when they leaſt thought of any ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) to be deliuered: and all this forſooth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord (euen without the miniſtery of ſecondary cauſes) woorketh and accompliſheth whatſoeuer it pleaſeth him. Wherfore let vs ſo eſtéeme of ſecondary cauſes as they deſerue, and by no meanes refuſe them: but yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all we muſt hold this, that God diſpoſeth and diſpatcheth all in all.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:21193:56"/>
                     <p>Firſt of all they haue defined fate, as <hi>Cicero</hi> reporteth in his <hi>2.</hi> book of <hi>Diuination,</hi> to be an order and courſe of cauſes, when one cauſe begetteth another in it ſelfe. And there in the fame place <hi>Cicero</hi> intending more expreſſely to deſcribe the force of Fate, addeth, <hi>That it is an euerlaſting trueth flowing from all eternitie. Which ſith it is ſo, there is nothing doone that was not to be doon: and in like maner no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be doone, wherof nature contayneth not effectuall cauſes to bring it to paſſe. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are giuen to vnderſtand, that it is not Fate which ſuperſtitiouſly, but which phyſical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is ſaide, to be the euerlaſting cauſe of thinges why both the thinges that are paſt were doon, and the thinges that be preſent are doone, and thinges that are to come ſhall be doone. And ſo it commeth to paſſe, that by obſeruation it may be marked, what thing for the moſt parte followeth euerye cauſe, although not alwaies, (for that were very hard to affirme) and that the ſelfeſame probable cauſes of things to come are ſeene of thoſe, that either in madnes, or in ſleep doo beholde them.</hi> Hitherto <hi>Cicero.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is extant alſo a definition of Fate, in <hi>Gellius</hi> in his <hi>6.</hi> book and <hi>2.</hi> chap. put foorth by <hi>Chryſippus</hi> a principall piller of the <hi>Stoicall</hi> diſcipline. For he deſireth it to be, <hi>A certaine
<pb facs="tcp:21193:57"/>naturall courſe or order of all thinges follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one an other from eternitie, and the ſame folding &amp; wrapping togither of things remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnchangeable.</hi> In which two places vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedlye there ſéem ſome thinges to be contained, which doo not agrée amiſſe to Gods prouidence, as it hath of vs alſo oftentimes héeretofore béene deſcribed. But beſides there are two other opinions rehearſed of <hi>Cicero</hi> in his booke <hi>de Fato,</hi> of the Philoſophers tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Fate. The one of thoſe that thought all thinges to come to paſſe by Fate, ſo as that Fate ſhould bring neceſſitie: in which opinion were <hi>Democritus, Heraclitus, Empedocles, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle.</hi> Wherupon came this to be in the mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes of many, <hi>Ineuitabile fatum.</hi> The other of thoſe, vnto whom it ſéemed that without any Fate the motions of mens mindes are volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary. With whome alſo this diſtinction was vſuall: that in ſome thinges it might truly be ſaide, when the certaine cauſes were gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that they are not in our power, but that they muſt of neceſſitie come to paſſe wherof they were cauſes: but in ſome thinges, though the cauſes were gone before, yet that it is in our power, that they ſhould otherwiſe come to paſſe, and that thoſe thinges forſooth doo properly come to paſſe by Fate or fatally, but
<pb facs="tcp:21193:57"/>from theſe that fate is abſent. Further of theſe two opinions all for the moſt parte doo eſpecially condemne the former: but the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (inaſmuch as it maketh the motions of mindes voluntary &amp; free, exempting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the power and iuriſdiction of Fate) they doo the rather approue: and we which acouch particular prouidence (they ſay) doo intend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to eſtabliſh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> former aſſertion, and as for the libertie of will (which yet that they might keepe ſafe, it pleaſeth them only to allowe of vniuerſall prouidence) that we vtterly take it away: and that ſo our meaning is againe to iuſtifie and vpholde that philoſophicall doctrin touching fate, which hath already been reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of all men. Moreouer in the woord Fate and in the ſundry names therof, eſpeciallye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Greekes,</hi> the whole force (in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) of Gods prouidence (ſuch as we affirme it to be) ſéemeth to be expreſſed of the ancient writers: ſo that now nothing is thought to let, but that aſwel in opinion as in flat termes we doo fully agree in all pointes with them.</p>
                     <p>For firſt they will haue <hi>Fatum</hi> to be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from the Verbe <hi>Fando,</hi> to ſpeake, as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arro</hi> in his <hi>5.</hi> book <hi>de Lingua Latina,</hi> and ſo by the woord Fate they plainelye inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate into all mens mindes, that it is nothing
<pb facs="tcp:21193:58"/>els, then that which is decréede in the minde of God, and (that it might vnchangeably come to paſſe) as ye would ſay by expreſſe voice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and pronounced.</p>
                     <p>And this is the very ſame in effect which we call prouidence. The woord Fate ſeemeth not to differ much from thoſe phraſes of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture euery where extant, <hi>God ſpake the word, thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> and ſuch like: by all which the ſence and meaning of Gods prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and power is made manifeſt vnto all men. But of the <hi>Grecians</hi> Fate or Deſteny is adorned with many tytles, wherof euery one dooth after a ſorte ſet before our eyes ſomewhat, wherby the diſpenſation and power of the diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinence is more céerly laid open vnto vs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cryſippus</hi> interpreteth it to be <hi>Pepromenen,</hi> called as you would ſay <hi>Peperaſmenen,</hi> (that is to ſay) limited &amp; brought to an end, becauſe that by it all thinges are finiſhed and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. <hi>Peratoo,</hi> is as much to ſay as <hi>termino,</hi> to finiſh or conclude.

Wherupon alſo they haue termed it <hi>Eirmon,</hi> that is to ſay, an order or connexion. <hi>Eiro,</hi> is <hi>necto,</hi> to knit.

<pb facs="tcp:21193:58"/>neceſſitie, becauſe that whatſoeuer is decréed by Fate or Deſtiny, is of neceſſitie to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed without any change or alteration.

                        </hi> is to parte or deuide.</p>
                     <p>Wherfore alſo they haue termed <hi>Moiras,</hi> the ſame which we call <hi>Parcat,</hi> or Ladies of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny, foraſmuch as they are <hi>Memeriſmenai,</hi> that is to ſay diſtributed or deuided particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly vnto euery one: which alſo are thrée in number, according to the three partes or por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of time, to wit, preſent, paſt, and to come. And <hi>Lacheſis,</hi> forſooth (being the name of the firſt) hauing reſpect to the time to come, willeth euery man to expect his lot &amp; chaunce. For <hi>Lankano,</hi> is as much to ſay as <hi>Sortior,</hi> to giue or take lottes. <hi>Atropos,</hi> (the name of the ſecond) being as you would ſay <hi>irreuertibilis,</hi> or vnreturnable, hath regarde to the times paſt, which cannot be reuoked or called back, <hi>Propâo</hi> and <hi>Prepo, verto,</hi> to turne. <hi>Chlotho,</hi> (the third) is attributed vnto thinges preſent,
<pb facs="tcp:21193:59"/>which are by a perpetuall order rolled and whirled about. <hi>Clotho, <hi>circum volo,</hi>
                        </hi> to turne about. Theſe thinges (I ſay) and many moe beſide are vttered of the philoſophers, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Fate or deſteny, and the ſame ſeem not to be a little conuenient to the ſetting forth of the dignitie of prouidence wherof we ſpeake: wherby it commeth to paſſe, that ſome goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to perſwade the vnlearned, that we haue drawen thoſe thinges, which we alleadge of Gods prouidence, eſpecially particular, for the moſt part out of the bookes of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, or at leaſt wiſe that ours doo not much differ from their ſayinges, and that ſo the doctrine of the <hi>Stoikes</hi> touching Fate is by vs throughly broched againe and reuiued. But we wil ſhew by certain very ſubſtantiall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that there is no agréement betwéene vs and the <hi>Stoikes,</hi> either as touching their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or as touching their tearmes and titles.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>1</hi> And firſt in generall this we ſay, that the place concerning Gods prouidence is one of thoſe, that the Philoſophers haue moſt filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defiled and corrupted, as they haue doon all other in a manner wherin the chéefe points of our religion are comprized. Wherfore albeit they haue put foorth ſome thinges aright tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Gods prouidence vnder the name of
<pb facs="tcp:21193:59"/>Fate, yet haue they againe deuiſed many moe (after their manner) vtterly diſagréeing from the trueth, for which cauſe we will by no meanes haue any fellowſhip or ſocietie with them. For how ſhould they doo otherwiſe that are deſtitute of Gods woord, from which alone ought to be fetched a right iudgement tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching high and heauenlye thinges?

Neither that there is any great need, why he ſhould trouble his maieſtie about the thinges heere belowe, ſith it cannot be choſen but that all thinges ſhall fall out for the beſt, after that the whole care and adminiſtration therof be once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to thoſe connexed cauſes.

But we being taught out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, doo teach that God himſelfe woorketh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where, and reacheth foorth his handes (if we may ſo ſpeak) euen vnto euery thing that is: and that all thinges doo in no caſe ſo depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vpon the labour of connexed cauſes, but that without their helpes and miniſterye very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny notable thinges are wrought and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed by God in theſe inferior matters héere belowe.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <hi>3</hi> There are many other thinges touching
<pb facs="tcp:21193:60"/>Fate broched afterward by the Philoſophers which agree not with the pure doctrin of Gods prouidence, neither can they by any meanes be reconciled togither. Of which ſorte is that eſpecially (to omit the reſt) which was before cyted out of <hi>Cicero,</hi> namely that it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued by the vnwearied actions of cauſes con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nexed or knitte togither, what thing for the moſt part dooth follow euery cauſe. This thing doubtleſſe in this diſpenſation of things by Gods prouidence cannot be perceiued, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as many thinges come to paſſe very oftentimes, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which mans reaſon ſeeth no cauſes at all either principal or acceſſory: and of many great and mightie woorkes there can no other cauſe be rendred, then the good and vnreproueable ivill of the Lord. As no man knoweth the counſell of God, ſo are the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of many thinges vnſearchable, and good reaſon, ſith in very deed it were not expedient for a man al waies to knowe them. In like manner, whither Fate woorketh in all things or whither mans will be exempted from the decrées therof, the Philoſophers could neuer certainly determine, and that aſwell becauſe they were hindred by the darknes of the fleſh alwaies erring in ſuch matters, ſo as they could not diſcerne the light of the trueth: as
<pb facs="tcp:21193:61"/>alſo for becauſe they had not the rule &amp; ſquire of Gods woord, without the which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that any ſound and certain iudgment ſhould be giuen. Wherupon it came to paſſe, that the Philoſophers alſo the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues laughed one another to ſcorne in diſputing about that matter: which thing <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his <hi>6.</hi> booke touching the Preparation of the Goſpell re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth of <hi>Oenomaus</hi> the <hi>Cynick,</hi> who contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and diſdainfully reproued both <hi>Democri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> and <hi>Cryſippus,</hi> yea and <hi>Apollo Pythius</hi> alſo him ſelfe: the one forſooth, becauſe he made the moſt excellent parte of man altogether bond and ſeruile, the other, for that he made it ſelf bond or half ſeruile: and <hi>Apollo,</hi> for becauſe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he knew al other things, yet was he igno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rant of what things we are the woorkers and authors, and what thinges depend vpon the execution of our will. The ſame man further derideth the Philoſophers, for that they could not agree among themſelues, whither <hi>Eímer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>méne</hi> or <hi>Pepromene,</hi> that is to ſay, Fate or Deſtenye were of God, or no, the one affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, the other againe denying: <hi>Epicurus</hi> at the length (full wiſely) concluding, that the ſame is confected and made <hi>ex atomis erranti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> that is, of wandring motes, paſſing too and fro by the way, and flittring héere and

We will adde a further matter, that enen the very name of Fate is to be ſhut out from amongſt us heerafter, if we couet to retaine our religion in her naturall puritie. For ſeeing that as oft as the name of Fate is heard, many abſurdities doo foorthwith ſeaze vpon the mindes of all that heare it, and ſuch as are clean contrary to the principles of true Diuinitie, doubtleſſe we are of that minde, that the ſame can in no wiſe be admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our congregations, without great feare of dangerous infection, let it be reicited amongſt thoſe prophane and baine ianglinges, which the Apoſtle <hi>1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 6.</hi> willeth to be auoided as alſo we ſee the holy Fathers, eſpeciallye <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> carefally to haue ſhunned it. Let vs imprint in our minds the ſaying of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame <hi>Auguſtine</hi> againſt them which out of the place of <hi>Iohn. <hi>8, No man could lay hands on him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his hower was not yet come:</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:21193:63"/>or Fate.</hi> And thus much hitherto touching Fate.</p>
                     <p>Further the place admoniſheth vs to ſhew that neither chaunce nor fortune hath any place, where the force of Gods prouidence is in ſome ſorte weighed and conſidered. There is no néede heere of any long diſputation, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſith none haue ouer much laboured to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or admixe fortune or chaunce with the diuine prouidence of God. It is apparant e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that the thinges falling out by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and chaunce are ſaide to be thoſe, that doo ſomtimes happen accidentlye and beſides mans expectation, which otherwiſe neuer or very ſeldome are woont to come to paſſe. And that which after this ſorte happeneth vnto a man, that may deliberate and deal by aduice, they will haue it ſaide properly to be <hi>Fortui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> or a thing happening by fortune: as if a man digging in the feelde to ſet or ſowe, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a treaſure: and that which happeneth to ſome other thing voide of reaſon, they aſcribe to chaunce: as if a ſtone falling from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houſe top, killeth a Dog that paſſeth by. Wherfore curious men haue endeuoured to ſearche and ſéeke whence theſe thinges ſhould come, and why they ſhould rather be thus then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, when yet there is no doubt but they
<pb facs="tcp:21193:63"/>might haue happened otherwiſe: and when they could not finde what cauſes to alleadge in ſuch euentes, they being ouercome with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration iudged, that it muſt of neceſſitie he ſome diuine matter, and that called they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune or chaunce, by little and little alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it a Goddeſſe, by whoſe beck and will the greateſt part of mens affaires might be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and gouerned. Wherupon alſo we reade that ſhe was woorſhipped and honoured with diuine honors like vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other Gods: and the matter came to this point, that whatſoeuer proſperitie or aduerſitie befell, men aſcribed it only and alone to fortune, yea and it grew to be an vſuall ſpeech, that then any thing was to fall out either well or ill, when it pleaſed Fortune ſo to haue it. Hence ſprung thoſe ſpeeches. <hi>If Fortune liſt and pleaſed be, I ſhall, attaine to hye degree. &amp;c.</hi> But we beeing taught out of the holy Scriptures, touching the Prouidence of God, and knowing that by it euen the leaſt and vileſt thinges that be are diſpenſed &amp; accompliſhed, doo aſcride nothing at all either to chaunce or fortune, nay we are of this minde, that there is not ſo much as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny chaunce or fortune: but doo attribute all thinges vniuerſallye whither they be ioyous or greeuous vnto God him ſelfe, who ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb facs="tcp:21193:64"/>whome he will with benefites, and to whom he will ſendeth contrarye calameties. Of all which thinges whileſt he hath the true and certaine cauſes in a readines, and the maner of woorking by them, it is enough and ſufficient: neither for that we are ignorant of the cauſes, or of the meanes, ought any thing in them to be accoumpted <hi>Fortuntum,</hi> or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out by fortune or chaunce. Heerupon we ſée in the Scriptures, that al things both good and had which may happen, are propounded and ſet foorth by the names of Gods bleſſings and curſinges, and likewiſe of promiſes and threatninges: to the intent verily we might deerely learne, that no ſuch matter is to be aſcribed vnto fortune (whither we liſt to call it good or euill) but all thinges to God alone, who ſaith expreſſely by his Prophet, that it is <hi>he that created good end euil, that maketh light and darkenes, &amp;c.</hi> There might I graunt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinges, which happen ſo vpon the ſodaine and vnlooked for, be ſaide after a ſort to fal out by Fortune in reſpect of vs, and after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine manner of ſpeaking (from which it muſt be abandoned the fond imagination touching any ſuch ſeuerall power of Fortune as giueth and beſtoweth all thinges vpon whome ſhe will) but yet in reſpect of God, we hath (as it
<pb facs="tcp:21193:64"/>is euident) preſt and ready cauſes of all things that come to paſſe, nothing can be ſaid to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by Chance or Fortune.

                     <p>For this is a moſt certaine role to anſwere directly vnto euery queſtion touching the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of thoſe thinges that are ſeene to come to paſſe, namely, that they are all wrought and accompliſhed by Gods good will &amp; prouidence.

<pb facs="tcp:21193:65"/>And firſt touching Chance.

But <hi>Abraham</hi> had ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that <hi>The Lord would prouide him a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fiſe,</hi> being aſſured by faith that the Lord wold do whatſoeuer was expedient: and the ſame Ramme became there a figure of Chriſt: <hi>Gen. 22.</hi> Again that the Caſket wherin <hi>Moſes</hi> was put, ſhould ſlote néere to the place, where <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi> daughter was gone downe to waſh her ſelfe, appéereth to haue hapned by chance: but for what great and weighty cauſes the Lord diſpoſed it ſo to come to paſſe, al the holy books of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bible do moſt plentifully witnes: <hi>Exod. 2.</hi> Further we would ſay that it was by chance, that the iron of the Are wherwith one of the ſchollers of <hi>Elizeus</hi> hewed timber, fell into the water: but therby tooke the Prophet occaſion to woorke a miracle, wherby he teſtified his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable faith to God-ward, and his lou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </hi> And by this meanes, the Lord him-ſelfe orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the lotte, was <hi>Saule</hi> found out to be anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with oyle, and ſo to be declared King: <hi>1.

                     </p>
                     <p>May it not be thought alſo worthily to fall out by Fortune, that <hi>Rebecca</hi> rather then any other ſhould giue drinck to the vnknowne ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp; afterward adde that ſhe would in like manner draw water for his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melles? But ſurely the Lord wold haue theſe thinges to be for a ſigne, wherby the ſeruant might knowe what manner of one ſhe was that his Maſters ſonne ſhould eſpouſe: <hi>Gen 24</hi> would not all men likewiſe ſay that Fortune hare a great ſtroake, when <hi>Dauid</hi> being thriſe
<pb facs="tcp:21193:66"/>purſued of <hi>Saule</hi> with a ſpeare or Iauelin to haue thruſt him through, eſcaped yet ſafe and ſound?

But there in that place the Lorde himſelfe is ſaide to haue compaſſed about the men that lifted vp their hand againſt the king and to haue iudged for <hi>Dauid: 2 Sam. 18.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therfore to conclude, what things ſoeuer do happen ſo vpon the ſodaine and vnlooked for that there appéere no cauſes why they ſhould ſo come to paſſe, when yet they might fall out otherwiſe, muſt be referred to the will &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God as vnto the chéefe and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall cauſe. But if thou wilt ſtill tearme them <hi>Fortuita</hi> or falling foorth by fortune after the vſuall manner and cuſtome of ſpeaking: yet muſt thou néedes graunt this, that except the

                     <p>But firſte there is a certaine difference to be ſet downe, which ſeemeth vnto me méet to be obſerued betwéene Contingence and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune or chaunce. For chaunce and fortune of which we haue ſufficiently ſpoken (if I be not deceiued) are referred cheefely to things exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, corporall, and indifferent or meane, and likewiſe to ſuch as happen beſides the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
<pb facs="tcp:21193:68"/>of our expectation or deliberation: but Contingence is extended of the Diuines euen to thinges internall and ſpirituall, concerning the ſaluation or damnation of the Soule, yea and to thoſe alſo wherunto is admitted both deliberation &amp; choice. So when one walking or beholding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtars, faleth into a ditch or ſink: that they ſay is <hi>Fortuitum,</hi> but when a man is inclined rather to this ſide then to that, and ſinneth or ſinneth not, they ſay that commeth to paſſe by Contingence. Wherfore they haue defined Contingence or Haphazard to be that, wherby thinges created in actions ſubiect to reaſon are oftentimes changed and altered, and doo fall either into theſe actions or into thoſe according to the choice and liberty gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God. From which difinition we may cléerely gather, that the cauſe and fountain of Contingence is the frée will of man, whereby he is moued to this or that as ſéemeth good vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Which libertie as it were a ſin vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to take it away, ſo déeme they it neceſſary to eſtabliſh Contingence. Albert they are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued alſo with an other cauſe, and the ſame much greater and waightier. For in caſe it be not graunted, that thinges fall out Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently by mans frée will, it will come to paſſe that ſinne ſhalbe imputed vnto God himſelfe,
<pb facs="tcp:21193:68"/>as by whoſe prouidence man ſhall ſo be holden bound and fettered, that he cannot chooſe but ſinne, although otherwiſe he ſhould ſtriue to the contrarye. Heereupon ſtraightwaies was brought into Chriſtian ſchooles out of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers dark dennes, a diſtinction of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, wherby one is ſaide to be Neceſſitie abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute or of the conſequent (otherwiſe according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> called Determinate, according to <hi>Cicero,</hi> Simple) wherby thinges ſtand at ſuch a ſtaye, as that nothing there can be changed: as <hi>Luke. <hi>24.

This ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie therfore they call neceſſitie of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. But verily we wil ſhew how néedleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe thinges are concluded, and how much they detract from the dignitie of Gods Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb facs="tcp:21193:69"/>beſides that they are not grounded v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon any ſure foundation, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futing euery thing in the ſelfe-ſame order wherein they are of vs rehearſed, and then with ſome reaſons and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples eſtabliſhing our opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and aſſertion.</p>
                     <p>But firſt and formoſt me may ſay this in generall: that if we did ſo religiouſly as were conuenient honor and imbrace the prouidence of God, on euery ſide turning and conuaying it ſelfe, and procuring and determining all things, yea the leaſt and vileſt thinges, euen to the numbring and conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of euery the haires of our head: and that we did moreouer ſeriouſlye weigh &amp; conſider, how ſmall or none at all our libertie and fréedome is, how ofte our will is letted and hindred euen in outward and trifling matters (for indéed the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; acknowledgement of theſe two thinges is very requiſite and neceſſarye, as alſo moſt profitable to illuſtrate and ſet foorth the glory of Chriſt) and laſtly if we called to mind, that it may be proued many other waies, that God is in no wiſe the author of ſinne, neither that it followeth euer the more by the aſſertion of particuler prouidence, as we haue before ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: Verily I would ſuppoſe, that euery man might eaſily perceiue and ſee, that there were no need or neceſſitie at all to auouch Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb facs="tcp:21193:69"/>or Haphazard. But that ſhall become more plaine and euident, if we bring foorth our reaſons vnto theſe thinges that are alreadye breefely ſaid touching Contingence.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>1</hi> Firſt therfore euen by the difference that we noted betweene caſuall thinges and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingence may after a ſort our aſſertion be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. For if not ſo much as caſuall thinges are to be graunted, but that all ſuch ought to be reduced to the preſcription and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods prouidence: how much leſſe may it be graunted, that any thing commeth to paſſe contingenter or by Haphazard? It is not like that he that regardeth and diſpoſeth the leſſer matters, wil omitte or neglect the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: by the adminiſtration wherof his praiſe alſo and glory may be encreaſed. And from whoſe prouidence it is not lawfull to exempt ſo much as the fall of one poore ſparrow vpon the ground: it were very iniurious to think, that of the ſame are not prouided and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned likewiſe the ſeuerall actions of euery one. But if ſo be that by the ſame are directed thoſe actions alſo, which by an vſuall manner of ſpeaking are called Caſuall, and which we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be meane or indifferent, neither ſeruing at all to any principall cauſe (ſo farre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth as we can conceiue) as béeing not (euen
<pb facs="tcp:21193:70"/>then when they are doone) premeditated and forethought off by man: there is no doubt, but that by the ſelfeſame wiſdome are ruled and gouerned other actions, which are farre more graue and waightye, and ſuch eſpeciallye, as wherof depend the ſaluation or deſtruction of ſoules, and in which oftetimes dooth more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peere and may be ſeene the mightye and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull woorkmanſhip of God him ſelfe, then the power &amp; abilitie of mans ſtrength. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as by the prouidence of God Fortune and chaunce, ſo alſo Contingence is ſubuerted and ouerthrowen.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>2</hi> Neither is there any cauſe why they ſhould ſaye that Contingence or Haphazard doth not reach to the internall or ſpirituall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, wherin is handled the matters of the ſoule. For ſéeing Contingence is occupied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſuch actions as are ſubiect to reaſon, doubtleſſe they cannot be excluded from the order of theſe, by which a man incurreth the guiltines of ſinne, and for which he is arraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as guiltie before the tribunal ſeat of God: inaſmuch as theſe actions are doon and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed by reaſon, which dooth alwaies alſo eg and inuite rather vnto euill then vnto good. And theſe foreſaide actions are truelye inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall and ſpirituall (for why they procéed out of
<pb facs="tcp:21193:70"/>the cloſet of the hart) and doo defile the ſoule before God, Chriſte expreſſelye witneſſing it <hi>Math. <hi>15.</hi>
                        </hi> wherfore the power and dominion of Contingence ſtretcheth it ſelfe euen to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall actions alſo. For further proofe wherof it appéereth that by reaſon of theſe ſaide acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons eſpecially ſinfull and vitious, I ſay, and ſauouring of damnation, becauſe they are doon beſides the will of God, neither may God be eſteemed the author of ſinne, the occaſion was taken of graunting &amp; auouching of Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. It remaineth therfore that Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence reacheth to ſpirituall thinges, and chéef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the actions of ſinne. But from hence good God, what horrible inconueniences doo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly follow? If we ſinne by contingence: it appéereth that we doo wel alſo by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tingence and this doubtleſſe ſo much the more, by how much the leſſe it is in our power, and falleth more ſeldome that we doo well then ill. But if this be graunted, then ſhall alſo the eternall ſaluation or damnation of man be reduced to Contingence, and then when any is ſaued or damned euerlaſtinglye, it muſt forſooth be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to Contingence. Which if it be true, then ſhall predeſtination alſo be in danger, neither ſhal any thing be accompliſhed for and by it, but ſo farre foorth as men themſelues
<pb facs="tcp:21193:71"/>ſhall contingentlye or at all aduentures direct their owne actions. And there is in very deed betwéen Predeſtination and prouidence great affinitie and reſemblance, ſo that the one doth as it were ſupporte and fortifie the other. For why, Predeſtination beareth it ſelf as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the endes or effectes: and prouidence as intentiuely bent to the cauſes or meanes. Wherupon it commeth to paſſe, that as he that taketh away the meanes or cauſes, the ſame taketh alſo the effectes: ſo he that detrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth from the dignitie of Prouidence, muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of neceſſitie impare the authoritie of prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination. But rather then we ſhould thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Gods Predeſtination or prouidence to be any whit leſſened or diminiſhed, let vs ſtoppe both our eares, and as for that Contingence or Haphazard, ſo fooliſhlye inuented by mans reaſon: let vs neuer ſuffer it to come in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but with all poſſible diligence and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon inforcement let vs endeuer vtterly to ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſh, abandon and aboliſh it for euer.</p>

We verilye for our partes conſult and take counſell, we ſeeke for help and aide, we are carefull for all the waies and meanes, wherby we may bring that to an ende, which we haue once conceiued in our mind, and at length alſo we haue all thinges at hand which we long deſired: yet we ſee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes, euen when all things are in the beſt

And why is this: Doubtleſſe for no other cauſe, then for that the Lord ordained only ſuch beginninges to be, but determined to let and hinder the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. So in the Prophets are declared the counſels of the Iewes touching the calling of the <hi>Egiptians</hi> &amp; other forraine powers againſt the <hi>Babilonicall</hi> enemy at hand, as alſo in the bokes of the Goſpell their deuiſes are opened touching the way and meane how to obſcure and darken the noble ſame of Chriſtes reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and to ſuppreſſe his whole doctrine: but thoſe driftes of theires attained not their deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red endes, becauſe forſooth the Lord, when he ordained them to deuiſe ſuch fetches, did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ordeine them to be diſappointed of their expectation, and all thinges to fall out cleane contrary.

<pb facs="tcp:21193:77"/>Wherfor in this turning away of their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there was not made any change or altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods ordinance, but ſimplye y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his eternall decree: neither did any thing there come to paſſe Contingently or by Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hazard, but by Abſolute neceſſitie was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole buſines brought to an ende. As God in theſe cauſes prouided ſuch beginninges, ſo prouided he the proceedinges and ſucceſſe which we ſée did follow. And nothing verilye without moſt great and iuſt cauſes. For by that denuntia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of deſtruction beholde how many &amp; great good thinges followed. As wel <hi>Ezechias</hi> as the <hi>Niniuites</hi> were brought to the accknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and confeſſion of their ſinnes: then they became carefull to repent: the faith and feare of God were foorth with kindled and ſtirred vp in them: they were throughlye moued to call vpon God for mercy, to the amendement of their liues afterward: and (to be ſhort) their whole poſteritie hath a notable example of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in them propounded and ſet foorth. Againe by their meruailous preſeruation, the power and goodnes of God is excéedinglye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, and a document giuen to all ages for the confirmation of faith and hope. And ſith there was nothing doon there in vain, nothing without moſt graue and waighty cauſes and

                     <p>In like maner God prouided the treaſon or betraying of <hi>Iudas</hi> and the deniall of <hi>Peter,</hi> but he prouided withall the ſucceſſe of either of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be farre vnlike: namelye that it ſhould ſo fall out that the one being led with repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſhould craue pardon and obtaine it, the other that he ſhould fall into deſperation and periſh. And in either of them, ſith they ſéemed alike to be greeued and to be touched with repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, if neceſſitie of conſequence were to be regarded, it might be thought that they both obtained pardon: and euery man might ſaye, ſeeing the outward ſorrowing of <hi>Iudas,</hi> that he alſo of neceſſity became pertaker of forgiuences But that was not ſo, in as much as it was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe determined of God him ſelfe from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euerlaſting. And of ſo great a difference God had moſt iuſt cauſes and conſiderations, ſo as he can by no meanes be accuſed either of neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence or partiality. And ſo of al other things which albeit they may ſeeme in our opinion to come to paſſe moſt chéefely by Contingence or Haphazard, yet muſt it be determined, that

                     <p>Wherfore that we may once diſpatch and make an end of this diſputation touching con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingence, it ſhalbe much better for vs to ſpeak ſimply and plainly of thoſe things that happen (ſith it is certaine that nothing comes to paſſe without the will and diſpenſation of God) v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thoſe formes of ſpeaking, which we ſee to be vſuall in the holy Scripture, and ſo ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to yeelde ouer to the diuine prouidence the honor and dignitie which it deſerueth, then by ſtrange ſubtilties of woords, and vaine and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous diſtinctions, to miniſter occaſion of brauling, and alſo of doubting of the power and goodnes of God. And ſeeing the Scripture dooth euery where and very apparantly teſtifie and declare, that the Lord moueth, inclineth exciteth the hartes of men, hath them in his hand, directeth, and draweth them: alſo that the Lord cauſed them to fall, blinded, harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, deliuered into a reprobate ſence: againe that the Lord woorketh in men and by men that which ſeemeth right in his own eyes, and that the will of the Lord is euery where doone and accompliſhed: likewiſe that the goinges, willes, and actions of men are ruled and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by the Lord: further that the Lord gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
<pb facs="tcp:21193:78"/>power, ſtrength, and might, either to doo or not to doo any thing: Item that the Lord puniſheth the wicked, and approueth the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by ſending of ſundry and variable ſucceſſes vnto them: to be ſhort that he dooth all things after his own goodnes, power, and inſtice, and willeth and diſpoſeth to be doon whatſoeuer is doone, neither that any thing is ſo vile and baſe or (in our iudgement alſo) hurtfull, out of the which he draweth not ſome good: moreouer that we ſee all theſe thinges, and the Holy Ghoſt to ſpeake ſimply in this wiſe. <hi>It cannot be but that offences ſhall come: <hi>Math. 18.</hi> It cannot be auoided but that off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Neither is there extant in any (whoſe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie

                     <p>But to the intent we may aſwel yet more euidently confirme, that all thinges come to paſſe by the neceſſitie of Gods prouidence, and nothing contingently or by haphazard: as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that we may ſet before all the godlye as it were in a table, how and after what ſort it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth them to vſe the places that entreat of Gods prouidence, and the phraſes wherin the ſame matter is handled, in reading of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures: We ſuppoſe it will be athing woorth our labour, if we propound certaine hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoricall examples out of the Scriptures, and conſider in what points the force of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence dooth vtter &amp; declare it ſelf. Now ther

                     <p>Intending therfore to ſpeake of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> we are to conſider firſt and formoſt what y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord by his Prouidence determined ineſpeciallye to make knowne in him.

Firſt it is written <hi>Geneſ. 37.</hi> that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was beloued of his Father aboue all his bretheren, and that he was clad alſo in a partie colloured coat, and for that cauſe became very much hated of his brethren. Beholde a certaine beginning or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try into the matter, though appeering onlye a farre off, from the which afterward it came to
<pb facs="tcp:21193:81"/>the platforme touching the ſelling of <hi>Ioſeph:</hi> and which (although it were euill) God inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to vſe to the procuring of much good. Heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Ioſeph</hi> hath dreames in appeerance and outward ſhew very abſurd, but in trueth moſt certaine prognoſtications of great and moſt weighty matters to be accompliſhed in him.</p>
                     <p>As for Dreames they might ſeeme (if any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing at all) to fall out eſpecially by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingence or haphazard, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for light and vaine thinges: and yet that they were ſent of God, the very ſequell of the matter did declare. Doutles it is meruailous to beholde the maieſtie of God occupied euen about the diſpoſing of mens dreames. And for the ſame cauſe were theſe dreames very much ſuſpected of his bretheren, for they priuily fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that it might one day ſo come to paſſe as the dreames did portend, their conſcience no doubt telling them ſomwhat touching the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Gods prouidence, wonderfullye ruling and ouer-maſtering mens matters. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Father it is expreſſely added, that he kept this ſaying diligently in his hart. By which teſtimony the holy ghoſt declareth, that he was a moſt reuerend regarder of the diuine prouidence, and that he conſidered right well, that thoſe dreames were not ſent at all aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb facs="tcp:21193:81"/>but by the will of God, yea &amp; for great and weightye cauſes. But how came <hi>Ioſeph</hi> into <hi>Egipt?</hi> God put into the minde of <hi>Iacob,</hi> to ſend <hi>Ioſeph</hi> into the fieldes to ſéeke vp his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren. Neither in deede was this very thinge doone with-out the determinate puppoſe of God. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> beeing departed ſtayeth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feelds, wher he findeth one that ſetteth him the right waye, and beſides telleth him tydinges of his bretheren, where they are. As yet there was nothing doone without cauſe. For if this man had not been met withall, perhaps <hi>Ioſeph</hi> being wery would haue returned home, and of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines ſhould not haue gon forward. Wherfore albeit it may appeere that theſe thinges came to paſſe by contingence or haphazard, yet is it plaine that nothing was doon without the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of God And loe, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was no ſooner come into the ſight of his bretheren, but that they all eftſoones conſpire his death. They con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiue in deede a deteſtable fact, but yet ſuch as the Lord will immediatly alter, &amp; out of which ſhall come a ſinguler good. Onely <hi>Ruben</hi> dooth conſtantly intreat, perſwading rather to haue him caſt into a pitte, &amp; hoping by that meanes that he might priuily conuaye <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſafe vnto his Father. And this thing was procured by the Lord, leaſt their minds being as yet on fire
<pb facs="tcp:21193:82"/>they ſhould foorthwith defile their hands with their brothers blood. Albeit neither did this counſell of <hi>Ruben</hi> preuaile according to his de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſire. It was in déed good &amp; godly of it ſelfe, as that which would haue béen very ioyful to the Father, holſome to <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and no whit diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious to the bretheren, and therfore in our iudgement God ought of right to haue holpen forward the attempts of <hi>Ruben.</hi> But in vaine is mans counſayle let againſt Gods. As the counſell of them that would haue had hun de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed could not take the effect, ſo was it not expedient that his counſaile that coueted to ſaue him ſhould goe for payment: ſeeing they bothe were indifferently againſt the immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble decree of the Lord touching the promoting of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> in <hi>Egipt,</hi> which was altogether neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be perfourmed. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> therfore is caſt in to a pitte, as who ſhould ſay to be killed with hunger. In the meane time that outragiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of minde and boyling wrath in the brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren is for great good by little and little ſlaked and waxen colde. What then? Marry beſides all expectation comes me <hi>Iſmalitiſh</hi> marchants that way. But think not that any thing came to paſſe by haphazard. God himſelfe had very fitly drawen them to that place. For why, by this occaſion the bretheren changing their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
<pb facs="tcp:21193:82"/>conſult about the felling of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to the <hi>Iſmaelites.</hi> And héer a man may ſee the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall meane, which the Lord had preordayned for the conuaying of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> into <hi>Egipt.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this laſt deuiſe of the bretheren the Lord would haue to take place: and <hi>Ioſeph</hi> now is ſolde vnto the <hi>Iſmaelites,</hi> he acompanieth them directly into <hi>Egipt</hi> where he muſt one day bear the chéefe ſway. By the way I admoniſh, that heere was propounded and ſet foorth a wonder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full token and myſterye of Gods diſpenſation towards the firſt ſpringing Church, in that <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> was rather ſolde for the price of money, then by any other meanes (which might eaſily alſo haue beene deuiſed) caſt out. For in this behalfe there ought to appeere in <hi>Ioſeph</hi> a type and figure of Chriſte to be ſolde afterwarde in like manner. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> being ſolde, his party-cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lored coate dipped in blood is ſent vnto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, leaſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> olde man ſhould come to the kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſinne committed, and might think the Childe to be torne in peeces by ſome wilds beaſt. But beholde why God would haue <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> to be adorned of his Father with ſuch a garment, verily to this end that by this ſigne he might be induced to beleeue, &amp; be throughly perſwaded of the matter. And the Lord would therfore haue this conceit to be inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by the
<pb facs="tcp:21193:83"/>bretheren, and the Father to be perſwaded, leaſt the old man ſhould be carefull afterward to make any further enquirie for his Sonne: who vndoubtedly would haue laboured euen to his exceding coſte and charges, to haue fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched him back out of the middeſt of <hi>Egipt,</hi> if he had knowne him to be there. So farre foorthe was that neceſſarye to be fulfilled, which the Lord had alredy determined touching the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> into <hi>Egipt.</hi> That which followeth <hi>Gen. 38.</hi> belongeth not to <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> neuertheleſſe it contayneth notable inſtructions concerning Gods prouidence. For that we may adde this alſo as it were by the way, it is declared how <hi>Thamar</hi> taking the matter greuouſly, for that after the death of her huſband <hi>Er</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Iuda,</hi> his other ſonne <hi>Sela</hi> being promiſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, was yet giuen vnto another, ſhe in trim apparell, and faſhioned in a maner after the guiſe of Harlots, went into a common way: and that <hi>Juda</hi> came haſtilye thither the ſelfe ſame way, and companied with her, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſuſpected to be a Harlot, being in very déed his daughter in lawe, and gather with childe, giuing her for a pledge or token (inaſmuch as he had no reward in a readines to beſtowe on her) his ring, Staffe, and cloake. Now in this hiſtory many thinges, nay euery thing might
<pb facs="tcp:21193:83"/>ſéeme to fall out Contingently or by Hapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, (for what might be ſaide to be more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent, then to be clad in this or that gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to goe to this or that place, to reſort to a woman with a will to be naught with her, to giue a pledge or not to giue it?) if we were not taught by the Euangeliſts <hi>(Math, 1. Luke. 3.)</hi> very cleerely and manifeſtlye, that euery thing was ſo diſpoſed and ordered by the Lord him ſelfe, vnto whom it ſéemed good by ſuch a meane to amplifie the ſtock and familie out of which Chriſt was to be borne, and to vſe the lewde and naughtye will of <hi>Iuda</hi> vnto good. Furthermore <hi>Ioſeph</hi> being entred into <hi>Egipt,</hi> what dooth he? Is he raiſed by and by to the adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the common wealth, or doth he haſtily thruſt forward him ſelf to intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with hard &amp; difficulte affaires? No verily. The Lord would haue as yet many things to goe betweene. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was already before once ſolde, <hi>Geneſ. 39.</hi> and not to any of the common ſort, but to <hi>Potiphar</hi> the cheefe ſteward of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> who beholding him to be adorned with excellent giftes of body and minde, betaketh vnto him the charge of his whole houſe and of all his goods. And thus would the Lord, (as it were) prepare <hi>Ioſeph</hi> after a ſort to vndertake great and waighty matters afterward, and to
<pb facs="tcp:21193:84"/>liue in ſuch a place, as where occaſion might be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both to heare and learn many things. Which that it might the more conuenientlye be accompliſhed, the Lord made ſuch ſignes to appeere in <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> as wherby al men might vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that euery of his actions were eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially gouerned by the heauenlye prouidence. Wherupon the Scripture there in that place, prouoking vs vndoubtedly to the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God prouidence euery where woorking, dooth ſomtimes repeate, that God was with <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and made all thinges to proſper that he tooke in hand. Now come we to thoſe meanes which it pleaſed God to vſe, in aduauncing <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> to ſo excellent a dignitie. Doubtleſſe to mans reaſon they might be though very fond and fooliſh, yea and ſome of them ſuch, as by which we might gather, that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forſaken of God then holpen. For why? he muſt fetch his beginning heere from the foule and filthy priſon, and muſt tread his firſte ſtep to glory through the path of extreame ſhame and ignominy. <hi>Potiphars</hi> wife burning in luſt, and feigning lies touching force to be offered vnto her by <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> was the cauſe, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guiltleſſe and innocent was caſt into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. But certainly Gods prouidence fleapt not in the meane time, as buſilye diſpoſing, how
<pb facs="tcp:21193:84"/>out of the ſinne of a ſhameleſſe harlot, and the miſteries of his ſeruant wrongfully vexed he might raiſe and procure many good thinges. Firſt he brought to paſſe, that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well liked &amp; accepted of the ruler of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and in that reſpect was ſo muh the better prouided for. For thus ſaith the Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely: <hi>But God was with <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and gaue him fauour in the ſight of the maiſter of the priſon.</hi> Heerupon the ruler committed alſo vnto <hi>Ioſeph</hi> the charge of all the priſoners. And ſo <hi>Ioſeph</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in bonds, yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord ſo ordaining, beareth ruler: ſo trulye might it be ſaide, that he all the time he was in <hi>Egipt,</hi> did nothing els then exer cile a perpetuall kinde of gouernement, &amp; play the part continually of a maiſter, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was ſolde to be a bond ſeruant. He had borne authoritie in <hi>Potiphars</hi> houſe, he beareth authoritie in the priſon, and euery where happily: it remaineth only that he be preferred ouer all <hi>Egipt,</hi> to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne it with like felicitie. And to this dignity he was aduaunced by this occaſion. There were in the priſon at that time <hi>Pharaohs</hi> But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and Baker, as it is written <hi>Geneſ. 40.</hi> Theſe men, as it happeneth ſometimes; had Dreames, wherwith they were not a little troubled. But note héer againe, that dreames are induced of God and that not without a
<pb facs="tcp:21193:85"/>cauſe. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> as he was taught of God (for ſo he ſaith there: <hi>Are not interpretations of God?</hi>) declareth the ſignification of the dreames, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are moſt certaine fore demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions touching the iſſue of either of their cauſe After three daies the thing it ſelfe approued the trueth of the interpretation, whilſte the one (as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had foretolde) was hanged vpon a tree, and the other reſtored to his former of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. But when two yéeres were expired after that, King <hi>Pharaoh</hi> him ſelfe <hi>(Geneſ. 41.)</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently troubled with ſtrange and vnaccuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed dreames, neither deſired he any thing ſo much, as to hear of ſome one, that could tell him the meaning of them, and what they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokened. Sée héere the counſell and purpoſe of God. When as there could none be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the wiſe men of <hi>Egipt</hi> (of which ſort there were the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many) that could ſay any thing (in effect) to the matter, the Butler, (not doubtles continge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly or at al aduentures, but God plucking him (as it were) by the eare,) remembreth <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and ſheweth <hi>Pharaoh</hi> of his dexteritie in expounding and interpreting of dreames. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> forthwith commaundeth him to be brought out of priſon vnto his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, without any delaye telleth him his dreames, and requireth him to declare the

And <hi>Ioſeph</hi> remembred the dreames which he dreamed of them.</hi> Beholde <hi>Ioſeph</hi> a diligent marker and obſeruer of Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence weigheth with him ſelfe, that it fell not out by Chaunce or Haphazard, that he being a. childe long before had dreamed, that he ſhould one day be woorſhipped of his bretheren For he ſéeth now the ſelfeſame thing to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled indeed. Yea and they alſo, when it was laide vnto their charges, that they were craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſpies, and for that cauſe were drawen into priſon, they conſtrued that they were not brought into danger raſhly and without cauſe but by the iuſt iudgement and ordinaunce of God, for thus it is in the text: <hi>And one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaid vnto another, verily we haue ſinned againſt our brother, in that we ſawe the anguiſh of his ſoule, when he beſought vs, and we would not heare him: and therfore is this trouble come v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon vs.</hi> For ſo did extreame neceſſitie wring this confeſſion from them touching the care and gouernement of God in and about mens

Let vs ſée therfore what means the Lord vſed to the accompliſhment heerof. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> diſmiſſeth not the men whome he called
<pb facs="tcp:21193:87"/>ſpies, but vpon this conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that one of them ſhould remaine in bondes, and the reſidue make promiſe, that they would bring with them their yongeſt brother alſo, of whom they had made mention. Furthermore he prouided that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> monye which euery one brought, ſhould priuily be conueighed into euery of their ſacks There is nothing doon héere Contingentlye or by Haphazard. For by theſe meanes it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them to be conſtrained to kéepe touch, to the end they might haſten their returne into <hi>Egipt,</hi> to know more neerelye the Lords will and pleaſure in time conuement. Verilye they finding their money in their ſacks, could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe iudge but that God cauſed it ſo to be <hi>What is this that God hath doon vnto vs?</hi> ſay they. Wherfore their Corne being ſpent, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reſtore their ſuſpected money, and partly to deliuer <hi>Simcon</hi> out of captiuitie, they are compelled to goe againe into <hi>Egipt,</hi> and to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Beniamin</hi> their yongeſt brother with them, as they had promiſed: <hi>Geneſ. 43.</hi> neither could they procure corne to be brought them by any other meanes. But whileſt they going away the ſecond time, their father <hi>Iacob</hi> praieth and wiſheth wel vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this wiſe, <hi>God almigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty giue you mercy in the ſight of the man, that he may deliuer vnto you your other brother, &amp;

But neither is it in vain, that at their fathers commaundement they carry giftes with them alſo. This was conuenient for thoſe, that ſhould not only by a vaine and long cuſtome in a receiued kinde of geſture, but alſo verily and in deed giue reuerence and woorſhip. And in that <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his brethren were come, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth them to be brought into his houſe, and great chéer to be prepared for them, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward alſo maketh merry with them, it auay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to this end and purpoſe, that they behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſo great a dignitie and power, might be moued to the greater reuerence: which thing they them ſelues doo after a ſort confeſſe, when (as the Scripture maketh mention) they ſaide they were brought in, to th'intent that beeing circumuented they might be brought into bon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dage, and for feare of ſo great a miſchéefe, they declared to the ſteward that they had brought the money againe without frat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At the length when the brethren had now ſo oftentunes woorſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped him, ſo oftentimes ſaluted him as their Lord and Maſter, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſéeing the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his dreames to be fulfilled, openeth him ſelfe <hi>Geneſ. 45.</hi> vnto them, ſignifying that he is the very ſelfeſame <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> whom they long before had ſolde to the <hi>Iſmaelites</hi> trauailing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Egipt:</hi> and to the end he might rid them of feare, he eftſones repeateth, that he was not ſent thither of them, but of the Lord, and that verily to the ſafetie and preſeruation of them all. And certes with ſo many ſundrye e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents and dangers comming betwéen, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in no wiſe by Contingence or Haphazard, ought that once to be perfourmed, which the Lord had preordained touching <hi>Ioſeph:</hi> and by what meane God prouided in the cauſe of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> ſuch an end, by the ſame alſo prouided he all thinges which he knew would be neceſſary
<pb facs="tcp:21193:89"/>and fitte to the ſame end. Laſt of all, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the olde father <hi>Iacob (Geneſ. 46.)</hi> goeth with his whole familye into <hi>Egipt,</hi> that it came to paſſe by Gods diſpoſition, euery man may vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand euen by his woordes vnto <hi>Iacob</hi> in the ſame Chapter ſet downe: <hi>Feare not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to goe downe into Egipt, for I will make thee a great nation, I will goe downe with thee into Egipt, and I will alſo bring thee back again.</hi> And by this occaſion not only is brought to an ende that which <hi>Ioſeph</hi> (taught of God by a dreame) had foreſeene ſhould be fulfilled in him ſelf, but alſo that which God two hundred yeers before had foretolde vnto <hi>Abraham,</hi> to witte, that it would come to paſſe that his poſteritie ſhould ſoiourne and ſerue in a ſtrange land. Very wonderfull doubtleſſe and ioyfull it is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, by what meanes and proceedinges God bringeth his determinations to paſſe.</p>
                     <p>And hither to touching the Hiſtory of <hi>Ioſeph:</hi> wherupon (inaſmuch as it dooth moſte cleerlye teach, that nothing though neuer ſo vile, and abiect, in appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to mans reaſon, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe contingently or by haphazard) we haue ſo much the more willinglye written all theſe things at large, for that our hope is, that god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and well diſpoſed mindes may héerby take an example, how in other holy Hiſtories alſo
<pb facs="tcp:21193:89"/>they ought to obſerue and mark the force and power of Gods prouidence euery where buſily occupied.</p>
                     <p>Now to the other Hiſtorie touching <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> ſeeking by fraud and force to inuade his Fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers Kingdome. We wil diſpatch the matter in fewe woords. How God diuerſely puniſheth ſinnes, neither ſuffreth he any to liue ſo ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but that he afflicteth them oftentimes with gréeuous diſtreſſes, although otherwiſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent men and déer vnto God, we may beholde it euen in <hi>Dauid</hi> alone: who after he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted adultery fell alſo into man-ſlaughter, and therfore he was to ſee his owne houſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> infamy of moſt ſhamefull whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and murders: with whoredome, when his daughter <hi>Thamar</hi> was defiled w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ammon:</hi> and with murder, when <hi>Abſolon</hi> ſlue his brother <hi>Ammon</hi> at a banquet.

                     <p>The ſame <hi>Abſolon</hi> after thrée yeers baniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by reaſon of the murder which he had commit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted, being returned home, and receiued into fauour, atempted moſt wickedly to thruſt his own father from the Kingdome, and to get it to himſelfe by force. Wherfore in this hiſtorie let vs ſée firſt of all the ſcope and drift of Gods purpoſe. God had determined to bring theſe
<pb facs="tcp:21193:90"/>thinges to paſſe, as we may eaſilye gather by the very order and courſe of the thinges doone: firſt and principally to exerciſe and humble <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uid</hi> with ſondry battayles, to the end he might afterward aduaunce him to the greater glory: ſecondly to deſtroy proud and ſubtill <hi>Abſolon:</hi> and thirdly by the ſame occaſion, in bringing a great ſlaughter vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people for their ſins, to reduce them into the right way. Now let vs weigh and conſider, by what meanes God ordayned theſe thinges to be accompliſhed.

<pb facs="tcp:21193:91"/>of God himſelfe, and from the ſame all manner of ſucceſſe was to be looked for, <hi>Dauid</hi> very plainly confeſſed, when as ſending backe the Préeſte and Leuites vnto <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> he ſpake in this ſorte vnto them: <hi>Carry the Arke of God againe into the Citie, if I ſhall finde fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour in the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me againe, and ſhew me both it, and the tabernacle therof: But if he thus ſay, I haue no delight in thee, beholde, heere am I, let him do to me as ſeemeth good in his owne eyes.</hi> A notable con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feſſion of a minde iudging all thinges to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only prouidence of God.

<pb facs="tcp:21193:93"/>and that it cannot be ſaid without the greate iniury of Gods name that any thing came to paſſe caſuallye or by chance-medley. Thus much of <hi>Abſolon,</hi> and I think, inough. For in that <hi>Dauid</hi> after a ſorte did beare héere a type of Chriſt, and they that cleaued to him a type and figure of the Church: on the other ſide in that <hi>Abſolon</hi> with his adhearents ſhadowed out the perſecutors and enemies of the goſpel, and that by the diuine prouidence ſo ordaining as in many other actions of the holy Fathers, we know a type and figure of thinges to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed by Chriſt apéered, there is no cauſe why we ſhould enter now into this field. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I ſuppoſe that theſe two examples are of vs in ſuch wiſe diſcuſſed and declared, as that euery man heerafter may eaſilye without any difficultie, by himſelfe finde out and determine in other holy diſcourſes alſo by like occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the places commending the force &amp; power of Gods prouidence: eſpecially ſéeing there is ſcarce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny narration to be found in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, wherin are not ſome ſuch places inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed, and that almoſte appéering manifeſt to ſight. And it behoueth vs to iudge, that it was procured by the ſinguler purpoſe and counſell of the holy ghoſt, that ſuch and ſo many places do euery where come to hand. For why, they
<pb facs="tcp:21193:93"/>doo not only preach and ſet foorth Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence woorking al in al things, which in trueth can neuer ſufficiently be blazed and diſplayde as it deſerueth: but alſo further they compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend manifolde and the ſame moſt ſwéete and holeſome doctrine. For they will vs eſpecially to acknowledge our owne weakenes and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie: they admoniſh vs to learne to depend wholy vpon God alone, to commend all our actions all our life long vnto him: they ſtirre vp faith in vs: they inuite vs to continuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation of the grace and helpe of God: they counſell vs to take in good parte, whatſoeuer happeneth amongſt men, and ſo they moue vs to modeſty. patience &amp; long ſufferance: final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they propound vnto vs in all thinges that come to paſſe, the diuine power, goodnes, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, attentiuely to be marked, and euer more to be praiſed. Séeing therfore theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are ſuch, let no man be of this minde to think y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are careleſſely to be paſſed ouer.</p>
                     <p>Wherfore by all theſe things we haue ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently and cléerely enough proued, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Fate or Deſtiny, nor to Chaunce, nor to Fortune, nor to Contingence or haphazard may any place be giuen at al in our ſacred phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophye, where iuſt regard is had of Gods prouidence, and the ſame worthily eſteemed.</p>

So muſt we in no wiſe doo. If we ſhall firſte ſpeake of foreknowledge, we
<pb facs="tcp:21193:95"/>muſt doubtleſſe be well reſolued, and conclude (as is méete) that God fore knew all thinges that are or euer ſhall come to paſſe, neither may we thinke that any thing can come to paſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to his foreknowledge. But from hence we muſt alſo procéed to prouidence, and determine with our ſelues, that according to this, God, ouer and beſides that he knewe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſequeale and ſucceſſes of thinges, doth alſo further by this inſearcheable wiſdom or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and diſpoſe all thinges, as we haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy oftentimes and with effectuall and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial reaſons proued and declared: neither that there is any thing among thecreatures either ſo vile or glorious, which may iuſtly be exemp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted from the iuriſdiction of prouidence.

And foreknowledge doubtleſſe ſéemeth after a ſorte to depend vpon prouidence. For the Lord knew before how and after what ſort he would deale with euery man, yea euen

                        </gap>felye in mens matters, there is no place to be giuen to Fortune or Fate, neither commeth any thing to paſſe by Chaunce or Contingence. But to what end doo I repeate theſe things in this order? what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer hath of vs hitherto beene declared tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the prouidence of God, and ſufficientlye approued by the teſtimonies of holy ſcripture, all that may and ought to be taken for excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent doctrine, and ſuch as floweth from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of Gods woord. I will adde a few things touching the excellencie and neceſſitie of this doctrine.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Verily I dare be bolde to ſay, that among many places of heauenlye philoſophie, though otherwiſe right notable and rich, there is none extant ſo commodious and plentifull, wherby the glory of almightye God may be inlarged and illuſtrated amongſt vs, as is this place
<pb facs="tcp:21193:102"/>which we haue handled touching Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: and ſpecially if it be ſhewed (in ſuch ſort as we haue doone) that this prouidence is not only vniuerſall, but alſo ſpecial and particular. For to take a charge and haue a care of euery thing, and not of mens affaires onelye, but of euery creature alſo, far beneath the ſtate and degrée of men: beſides to haue ſuch a care and regarde of mens matters, as euen their minds and willes alſo are directed to certaine actions and determinate endes: this doubtleſſe muſt be acknowledged a very diuine woorke, and that ſurelye ſuch a one, as wherein the power and glorye of God are ſeene moſt cleerelye to ſhine and appéere.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 And what ſhall we ſay to this moreouer? that looke in what accompte and regarde that confeſſion of faith is had, wherby we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God to be God, and the ſame almightye, and in the ſelfe ſame (if we weigh euerye thing aright) is this doctrin alſo of Gods prouidence to be accepted and taken. For it is in déede the very ground and foundation of our faith. For why, be that acknowledgeth in God his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, eſpecially particular (wherof we haue principallye entreated) he vndoubtedlye it is that dooth rightly comprehend that principall article of our religion, and confeſſeth, what is
<pb facs="tcp:21193:103"/>in very déed to be aſcribed and attributed vnto God: on the other ſide, he that re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>cteth proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſinneth no leſſe nor otherwiſe, then if he denied God to be almighty.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed how ſhall a man fully giue vnto God this praiſe, that he is the creator of heauen and earth, vnleſſe we doo graunt in like manner, that the ſame is the moſt wiſe admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrator and conſeruator of all things in them contained? ſith in very déede it were moſt ſtrange and abſurde to thinke, that he that is beſt of himſelf, ſhould neglect, or by any means caſt from himſelf, and commit vnto others, the thinges that he hath once created: and that he that is almighty ſhould not be able to ſuſteine and beare the burthen and charge of all thoſe thinges. Breefelye therfore, by this doctrine touching Gods prouidence we are inſtructed and confirmed in the true acknowledgement and confeſſion of faith: and if ſo be we cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>te and behouefull, that we confeſſe in like caſe the prouidence of God effectually woorking all in all.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:21193:103"/>
                     <p n="4">4 In aſmuch as it is very neceſſary and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to haue the will of God alwaies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes, and that we ought as well in the firſt creation as in the perpetuall conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of all things to conſider the ſame, haue it in admiration, &amp; extoll it with praiſe: there is no man but ſeeth, that we can no other waies be brought to the dooing of this, then by the exact vnderſtanding of Gods prouidence, by the which alone all thinges come to paſſe, and amongſt them all nothing in vain or with out cauſe. Neither is there any douubt, but that the Lord himſelf would haue vs to be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp to the continuall beholding of his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, when as by his ſonne he taught vs to pray duely, that his wil might be doon in earth as it is in heauen, for why, to pray that Gods will may be doone, what els is it, then to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute and commit all things to his prouidence?</p>
                     <p n="5">5 And by this conſideration of Gods will we learne to judge moſt truely and rightlye of all thinges that come to paſſe, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to determin of them, then that they doo altogither fall out to the illuſtration of Gods glory, and to the procurement of the ſaluation of the godly. For whatſoeuer it be that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, the Lord vndoubtedly turneth it to ſome good, although we can by no meanes
<pb facs="tcp:21193:104"/>perceiue, how or after what ſort the ſame is accompliſhed. For like as the prouidence of God hath alwaies his omnipotencie ioyned with it, euen ſo is his excellent wiſdom, neuer remoued from the ſame. And againe, where all thinges fall out by his ſinguler wiſdom, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be thoſen but that the ſame doo fal out and are diſpoſed to many good endes and purpoſes.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 Laſt of all, ſith the firſt way to ſaluation is, to humble our ſelues vnder the mightye hand of God, to acknowledge our own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, to depend wholy and alone vpon God, to look for all thinges profitable and commodious from him, and to aſcribe all thinges that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and come to paſſe to the ſame: and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are moſt cléerely taught by this treatiſe of prouidence, how all theſe thinges ought to be doone and accompliſhed by vs: it is a plaine race, that without the knowledge and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of prouidence, we can by no meanes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto ſaluation. To conclude (that I ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry not long) he cannot truely profeſſe his faith in God, he cannot pray aright, he cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde and acknowledge the good wil and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God in all his woorkes: he cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe vnto God the glory of his excellent pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, wiſdome, goodnes, &amp;c. as he deſerueth: he cannot humble himſelfe (as is meet) before
<pb facs="tcp:21193:104"/>God, to craue his mercy or aide, that imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not the doctrine of Gods prouidence, or doth not purely vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the ſame. And thus much touching the excellencie and neceſſitie of this doctrine.</p>
                     <p>Now concerning the comfortes, wherun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we would haue eſpecially to be referred all that hath been ſpoken touching prouidence, we muſt intreat more fully and at large. Before all thinges, it is no hard matter to declare, that as wel the definition of Gods prouidence as alſo thoſe proofes, wherby we haue proued, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prouidence is neceſſaryly eſtabliſhed againſt the ſwiniſhe brood of Epicures &amp; others (whoſe mindes beeing déepely drenched in the quag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire of carnall opinions, can by no meanes be lifted vp to the contemplation of ſpirituall and heauenly thinges) doo miniſter moſt large and ample matter of comfortes and conſolations.</p>
                     <p>Certainly fith the whole life of man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſubiect to innumerable and the ſame very pernitious dangers, either open or ſecret, there is no cauſe why we ſhould think, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man can be in ſafety one minute of an hour vnleſſe he be preſerued by the ſpeciall proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God. Whither ſoeuer a man turneth himſelfe, doubtleſſe he is of all creatures the moſt wofull and miſerable, except be perceiue
<pb facs="tcp:21193:105"/>himſelfe to be enuironed &amp; vpholden with the ayde and aſſiſtance of Gods prouidence.</p>

If thou hiddeſt thy ſelfe in a houſe or Cotage, one pin or nayle broken or out of ſquare may cauſe the whole building to fall and ſo ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme thée. A ſilly Spider ſlipping from her webbe into thy boſome whileſt thou ſleepeſt, engendreth there ſome hidden ſore that gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth thée.

Thy Dog becomming madde, will no more forbeare thee then a ſtranger. If thou wilt ſéethe or roſte any thing for thee to eate (as doubtles thou canſt not liue without dooing of theſe and ſuch like actions) a little fire perhaps maye conſume the whole houſe: ſome peece of a wéede being put vnawares in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy pottage pot, will procure vnto thée ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſicknes or death: the knife wherwith thou

If thou drinkeſt, although it be very cleere water: yet it may be, that the well whence thou dreweſt it, ſome venemos worme hath infected with her poyſon. But if it pleaſe thee to goe out of the houſe, one tyle fallinge downe may breake thine head and peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thy braines: a little ſtone lying in the way eauſeth thee to ſtumble and fall, and ſo greeuouſly to hurt thee. Somtimes the ayre being groſſe of it ſelf, or otherwiſe for the time corrupted, will hurt and impaire thy health. How many beaſtes thou méeteſt, ſo many eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies maiſt thou think thou méeteſt withall, which ſome way that thou wéeneſt not may ouercome thée, or at the leaſt hurt thée.

I might more truelye ſay, that to euery member are procreated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable ſortes of diſeaſes. The eye doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe is a very ſmall part in the head: but with how many maladies thinkeſt thou this is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combred? There are ingendred in it the <hi>pinne and webbe, the blearenes of the eyen, the drye itch in the eye, the wart in the eye lid, the grauel in the eye, the dazeling of the eyen, the filme of the eye, the ſtaring of the eyen, the falling of the eye lidde, the dimneſſe of the eye, the poorblind<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of the eyen, the knob in the eye, the pricking in the eye, the dropping of the eyes, the ſquint, the ſwelling of the eyes, the turning of the eye liddes, the vnnaturall ſtanding of the eye liddes, the pimple in the eye, the pearle in the eye, the ſcurumes of the eyen, the ſwelling and groſſenes of the eye liddes,</hi> and who is able to reckon vp all the impediments of this ſort?

For if God diſpoſeth all thinges, and with ſinguler care fououreth, aduanceth and defendeth vs and our matters, as we haue ſufficiently at large and plainly be fore proued, when we taught that Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence was not onely vniuerſall, but alſo ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall and peculiar: then doutleſſe are we to look for all good things from him alſo. Neither may we think, that any thing ſhalbe wanting vnto vs, ſo long as we haue him fauourable that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for vs: and much leſſe that we can procure vnto our ſelues any thing by our owne deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, induſtrie, arte, ſtrength, vnleſſe be of his mercy miniſtreth it vnto vs. For he alone is almightie, and endued with a notable <hi>philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropie</hi> or loue towards mankinde: wherfore vndoubtedly he both can and will giue whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ſeemeth good vnto him, and our neceſſitie requireth. As for vs, howſoeuer we may ſeem
<pb facs="tcp:21193:113"/>to doo any thing by our owne induſtrye, or alſo by the helpe of others, whither it be of men, I ſay, or of any other creature: yet are we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to confeſſe, that the thing is farre leſſe which we do (though it be neuer ſo ſmal a mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter) then that it can without him be brought to paſſe as we deſire. It appereth in deed that we do ſomwhat, when we plough vp the land with our handy-labours, ſowe ſeedes in the fallowe ground, reape downe the ripe Corne, grinde the ſame at the mill, bake bread in the ouen: when we lay baites for fiſhes, ſet ſnares for birds, tend our cattell and flockes: when to accompliſh greater matters, we ſeeke for the ayde of others that are better able to perform them: when we procure freendes: when we miniſter helpe one to an other: when we learne and haue the knowledge of ſundrye artes, as the craft of Taylors, Carpenters, phiſick and ſuch like, and apply the vſe of them to neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry purpoſes: when we call vpon God by praier and ſupplication &amp;c. but all theſe thinges if we weigh them aright, are nothing els then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine inſtruments and meanes, ordayned and graunted of God himſelf, by the which it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him to woork in vs, and to ſet forward our affayres, inſomuch that if anye thing be once well doone and rightly accompliſhed, although
<pb facs="tcp:21193:114"/>we haue ſwet for it, yet it is neceſſary that the whole praiſe of the wel-dooing of the thing doo redound to him alone as the principall author and woorker of the ſame. For neither is the ſéed frutefull of it ſelfe: neither do Fiſhes or Foules wittingly and willingly come into our nettes: neither dooth fodder giuen to our Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell profit them: neither is their ſtrength auay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leable, whoſe helpe we craue: neither is euery man ſtraight waies mooued to freendſhip: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doo they alwaies requite good turnes, of whom we haue wel deſerued: neither are arts and ſciences by and by learned, nor their force and efficacie forthwith bewray it ſelfe: neither is the minde kindled vnto prayer: excepte the Lord himſelfe do ſecretly in all theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to woorke by his vnſercheable power, and proſecute that which he foreſeeeth will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and holſome vnto vs, and fit to illuſtrat and ſet foorth his owne glorye. Vaine and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous are all thoſe attempts, wherunto he putteth not his helping hand. And moſt true is that ſaying of the Prophet <hi>
                           <hi>Pſal. 127.</hi> Except the Lord build the houſe, they labour in vaine that build it: &amp; except the Lord keep the Citie, the keeper watcheth but in vayne. It is in vayne for you to riſe vp early, and to lye downe late, and cate the bread of ſorrow: but he will ſurely
<pb facs="tcp:21193:114"/>giue reſt to his beloued.</hi> And doutleſſe if we ſhould not be pertakers of our deſire before we could bring our wiſhed enterpriſes to paſſe by our owne ſtrength and power, how might we euer conceiue hope or comforte in our mindes: eſpecially ſith we dayly finde it true by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that our attempts and indeuors, though otherwiſe right honeſt and vertuous, are ofte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times eaſily letted and hindred, and that we cannot ſtretch forth ſo much as our little fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nay nor direct the thought or cogitation of our minde, but ſo farrefoorth as he ſhal turn and diſpoſe it.

Theſe are the thinges which we ſtand moſt in need off in our common courſe of life, and with the which he that courteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beyond the lawes of nature touching a ſober and moderate life, may content himſelfe: after which ſort alſo the Apoſtle ſpake full wel of himſelfe and of all that profeſſe Chriſte, <hi>1. Timoth. 6.</hi> Godlines, ſaith he, <hi>is great riches, if a man be contented with that he hath. For we brought nothing into the world, and it is certain that we can cary nothing out. Therfore hauing
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:21193:116"/>foode and rayment, let vs therewith be content.</hi> Now theſe thinges will God haue vs to looke for from him, and we finde by experience, that howſoeuer we beſtow al our labours and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes about them, yet we attaine not vnto them but by his liberalitie. True it is indéede, that theſe thinges are beſtowed vpon ſome more ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifully, and vpon other more ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but it cannot be denied, that there is giuen vnto all ſo much, as is ſufficient for the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſuſtentation of life. But if thou ſee'ſt more giuen to one then to another, yet thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to think, that there is nothing doone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out certaine aduice and iuſt cauſes.</p>
                     <p>Thou maruelleſt perhaps why he hath not giuen vnto thée great riches. But beholde how wiſely the prouidence of God dealeth with thee. Thy pouertie keepeth thée in an humble and thrifty eſtate of life, &amp; ſo thou art brought to imbrace other vertues alſo, which ſpring out of theſe: wheras otherwiſe, if thou flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edſt in riches after thy deſire, then becomming diſſolute through immoderate ſuperfluitie, thou wouldeſt apply thy minde to all manner of vices, and which is yet more greeuous, thou wouldſt drawe others alſo togither with thy ſelfe into ſhamefull ruine and deſtruction. Thy pouerty is the cauſe, why thou imployeſt thy
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:21193:117"/>ſtudy in learning and ſupernaturall philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, which otherwiſe thou ſhouldeſt neuer, I beleeue, haue taſted ſo much as a far off. Thy pouerty cauſeth thee, to behaue thy ſelf modeſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly towards all men, and diligently to imbrace freendſhip and peace: who if thou couldeſt challenge to thy ſelfe but ſo much as the name or title of a rich man, thou wouldeſt become greeuous and intollerable to all. Further he that would haue thée to be poore, the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uideth in the meane time, that nothing ſhall be wanting vnto thee, I ſay, for thy neceſſarye preſeruation. He moueth others, for the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which they perceiue in thee, to fauor thée, and to eudeuer to doo thée good. Yea and thy wife and Children (if thou haſt any) by reaſon of thy pouertie, become more ſtronge and luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and are ſtirred vp to diligence in dooing of their duties and following of their labours, which otherwiſe thou wert like to haue ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and vnthriftie, and rather burdenſome vnto thee then profitable. Beſides what a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite is this, that pouertie exempteth thée from many great &amp; greeuous annoyances, the which rich men, will they nill they, are infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to goe vnder: and how great they are, no man can eaſilye tell, but he that hath had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of them. But it ſhalbe good, for thee
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:21193:117"/>to weigh more exactly the ſpirituall benefites alſo, which doo come vnto thee by thy pouerty. It giueth thée occaſion continuallye to call v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Lord, whileſt thou requireſt of him thinges neceſſary for thee, and knoweſt them to be looked for from him alone.</p>
                     <p>It cauſeth thee from time to time to commend thy ſelfe and all thine to him onelye, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglye to depend vpon him alone. It maketh thee to become reſolute, ſo as the woord of God which thou haſt heard is not choked, through the thorny cares of richeſſe and voluptuouſnes in the feelde of thine hart. It taketh away alſo the nouriſhmente of ſuch temptations as the deuill is woont to ſtirre vp in the rich men of this worlde. It miniſtreth a manifolde exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of pacience. It encreaſeth and ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth thy faith. It prouoketh thée to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempte of pride, ambition, vaineglory, and of all earthly thinges, and perſwadeth thée to meditate and aſpire onelye after beauenlye thinges. Finally for many cauſes it is better for thée, when thou art in this ſorte poore and needye, then if thou hadſt plentye and aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all thinges.</p>
                     <p>It would be ouer long torehearſe all the cauſes that might be reckoned.</p>
                     <p>Thou vnderſtandeſt therefore that it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:21193:118"/>by the ſinguler wiſdome of God, and for thy incomparable benefit, that thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt liue contented with this thy poore eſtate and condition. Contrariwiſe thou maruelleſt againe, why God would haue this thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour or any other man to be rich. But to omit this, that no man can fearch out the cauſes of Gods will in theſe things: yet wil I demaund of thee, how thou canſt tell, whither the great riches wherwith thou ſeeſt him to be adorned, will he beneficiall vnto him, or rather perniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Either of them doubtleſſe may come to paſſe indifferently, but yet this laſt farre more commonly then the other. For where one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture among many that are endued with riches of God may be ſeene, that vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them to be as a certaine inſtruement of well dooing, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> namely he might be ſtirred vp by them to thankeſgiuing, that he might perceiue himſelf to be rather a ſteward ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then a Lord, and impart them to his needy brethren, féede the hungry, clothe the naked, comfort the ſick, ſuccour the captiue, aide miniſters of the woord, and to be ſhort laye them out to Gods glory and the help of his neighbour: yet maieſt thou ſée againe very many on the other ſide, vnto whom it appeereth plenty of riches to be giuen, that beeing vnthankfull for their bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:21193:118"/>receiued, are deſpiſed of God, and béeing deſpiſed are by little and litle blinded, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blinded doo abuſe the benefites graunted them for a time, and abuſing them purchaſe to them-ſelues eternall damnation. Of theſe thinges we haue moſt manifeſt experimentes and examples in the holye Scriptures. Poore <hi>Lazarus</hi> is commended, the poore Apoſtles are praiſed, and they alſo that contemptuouſlye reiected their riches not to be conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned: which all ſeemed ſo much the more redy to take their paſſage into heauen, by how much the leſſe they were hindred with the fardels of earthly thinges. We read alſo of certaine rich Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches, Iudges, Kings and other holy fathers: but theſe in the middeſt of ſo great riches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued notwithſtanding poore in ſpirit, and ſo vſed things preſent, as they would not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue cared if they had beene abſent. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it belongeth that <hi>Iacob</hi> going into <hi>Meſopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamia,</hi> praied vnto God, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would giue him eſpeciallye bread to eate, and rayment to put on: <hi>Geneſ. 28.</hi> Godly <hi>Iacob</hi> was not carefull for any moe benefites: and the Lord (we ſee) gaue vnto him euen more then he deſired. Likewiſe <hi>Abraham</hi> is reported to be rich, but yet ſo as he neuer bought ground, nor builded houſe. But we reade of other rich men, who through
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:21193:119"/>their great riches were brought to extream de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: of which ſort was that rich glutton clothed in fine linnen and purple, and faring deliciouſly euery daye: and an other who hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that after his cofers and barnes were fraughted to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> full, his ſoule ſhould immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be taken from him: likewiſe the yong man which had rather forſake Chriſte then his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, for whoſe cauſe alſo Chriſt took occaſion to treat of the infelicitie or pouertie of riche men, and amongſt other thinges ſaid. <hi>That it is eaſier for a Camell to goe through the eye of a needle, then for a rich man to enter into the kingdome of heauen:</hi> and other mo alſo, whoſe names the Holy-ghoaſt voucheth not ſafe to mention in his ſacred bookes. And ſuch are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the greateſt number of rich men, and this our age hath (alas) too too many routes of ſuch as theſe.</p>
                     <p>Therfore by theſe thou oughteſt to iudge, that it is neither hurtfull to thee, that the diuine prouidence hath apointed thee to be poore: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againe that it would be greatlye to thy profit, if it ſhould euen now commaund thée to be rich. True indeed is that ſaying of the wiſe man, that <hi>as well riches as pouertie come from the Lord:</hi> but we may ſay that this alſo is moſt true, namely that it commeth likewiſe from
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:21193:119"/>the Lord, <hi>that a man vſe them well and as he ought.</hi> And no man euer vſeth them well and as he ought to doo, but he whoſe minde reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the will of God, ſubmitteth him ſelf ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and reſteth in the determination of the diuine prouidence. And ſith in the common courſe of our life it is a great ſafegard and help to the appeaſing of the greefes and vexations of the minde, to be able, as <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh of himſelf. <hi>Philipp. 4. <hi>to be content with the eſtate wherin we are,</hi>
                        </hi> to be able for the time to be aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and to excell, to be able for the time <hi>to be full and to be hungrye, to abound and to ſuffer want:</hi> this alſo is a moſt ſure and certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, euen to waite vpon the Lord at all times by faith, for the thinges that he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to be requiſite and neceſſary for vs. And hitherto belongeth that notable Sermon of Chriſt. <hi>Math. 6. Luke. 12. <hi>Be not carefull</hi>
                        </hi> ſaith he, <hi>for your life, what ye ſhall eate, or what ye ſhall drinke: nor yet for your bodye, what ye ſhall put on.</hi> He addeth immediatlye an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent reaſon touching the prouidence of God, which is perceiued in the creation of man: Is <hi>not the life,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>more woorth then meate, and the body more woorth then raiment?</hi> as though he ſhould ſay: <hi>He that hath created and yet ſtill preſerueth both thy ſoule and body, the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:21193:120"/>ſame doubtleſſe will prouide alſo theſe leſſer thinges, I meane foode and rayment.</hi> There is added alſo another reaſon, where an argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is drawn from the leſſe to the greater. <hi>Behode the foules of the aier, for they ſowe not, neither reape, nor carry into the barnes: yet your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father feedeth them. Are yee not much better then they?</hi> Where are couched many comfortable reaſons. You are much better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the foules: there is no doubt therefore but he will much leſſe forſake you then them. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he prouideth for the birdes that take no paines at all: how much more will he prouide for you that labour luſtely in your callings for whom is prepared the vſe of ſecond cauſes? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, he is your Father: wherfore you ought to make this certain accompt that he is endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a fatherlye affection toward you, and that the ſame heuenly Father, will omit none of thoſe things, which we ſee to be perfourmed and accompliſhed by earthlye parentes. And leaſt any man ſhould perſwade himſelfe, that he could with his own labours prouide things neceſſarye for his life, Chriſte by an exquiſite preuention putteth the matter cut of doubt, ſaying: <hi>Which of you by taking careful thoght, can adde one cubite to his ſtature?</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Albeit ye bend all the force of your witte,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:21193:120"/>and exerciſe all maner of artes and ſciences, yet ſhall yee not be able to bring the leaſt thing to paſſe, if ye be not holpen hy the diuine aid, and if the Lord giue ye not increaſe.</hi> For thus in <hi>Luke</hi> it is expreſſely added: <hi>If ye then be not able to doo the leaſte thing, why take yee thought for the remnant?</hi> There followeth a more full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: <hi>And why care ye for raiment? Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Lillies of the feeld, how they grow: they labour not, neither doo they ſpinne. Yet I ſaye vnto you, that euen <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his glory was not arayed like vnto theſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our labour or wiſdome are able to doo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, no more then the Lillies are ſaide to doo any thing of themſelues, while they grow: but the Lord procureth all things as well in vs as he dooth in the plants or other cretures, which are vtterly voide of reaſon and induſtrie. And he amplifieth excéedinglye the greatnes of the benefites which we are to looke for from God, and willeth vs to be of a confident minde, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt he ſaith that the natiue beauty of Lillies is greater, then that which art (though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a reſembler of nature) can euer be able to expreſſe: yea then that was of <hi>Solomon</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, whoſe ſumptuous apparell not withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding did eaſely ſurmount the glory of all other princes, as the Scripture dooth witneſſe.</p>
                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:21193:121"/>
                     <p>Wherfore we muſt alſo look conſtantly for thinges neceſſary for this life from God, ſéeing he giueth thoſe thinges largely to Lillies that are not neceſſary, but ſerue in a manner for no other purpoſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for beuty onely. If ſo be the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he giueth more then néeds to the verye Lillies, which ſtand not in need of any ſuch beuty, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they greatly benifited by it: why will he not much more giue vnto men the thinges which this life cannot want, &amp; with the which it is ſo neceſſarye that men ſhould be holpen, that without them they cannot but periſh?</p>
                     <p>And againe he confirmeth this matter with another reaſon from the leſſer to the greater: <hi>Wherfore if God ſo cloth the graſſe of the feeld which is to day, and to morowe is caſt into the furnace: ſhal he not do it much more vnto you, o yee of little faith?</hi> In which compariſon he extenuateth the nature and conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of graſſe, that the vilenes therof being conſidered, our mindes may conceiue hope, that God will far more willingly &amp; carefully regard our affaires, ſith we be farre more excellent creatures, then are the ſenceleſſe graſſe. But it hath the force of a rebuke, in that he calleth them that are ſo carefull for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things of this life, <hi>holigopiſtous,</hi> that is, <hi>of little faith.</hi> For the ſenſe is this: <hi>If you were endued with true faith, ſuch as became
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:21193:121"/>them to haue that are called into the fellowſhip of Chriſt, ye would not dout of the goodnes of God: but would determine with a ſtedfaſt faith that God would liberally prouide for you.</hi> And this is it y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he meaneth in the woords following <hi>Therfore take no thought, ſaying: what ſhall we eate, or what ſhall we drinke, or wherwith ſhal we be clothed? for after all theſe thinges doo the Gentiles ſeeke.</hi> Beholde a vehement dehorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory or diſſwaſory reaſon. <hi>It is the propertie of the Gentiles</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which are without God, without hope, without faith, <hi>Ephe. 2.</hi> to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for earthly thinges: and all becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not as yet renued nor as yet adorned with the Holy-ghoſt, are giuen onely to earthly thinges, and ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not comprehend things ſpirituall.

But certes againſt all theſe matters the minde ſhall ſingularly well be fenced, that will diligentlye looke into thoſe thinges, that haue of vs beene taught touching Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. And howſoeuer euerye of them might affoord plentifull matter of conſolation, which thing, but for the time, we would eaſilye ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue: yet notwithſtanding this will eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly auaile to that purpoſe, if we ſhew that euen all croſſes alſo and calamities are wiſelye and for ſome profitable conſiderations ſent of God: ſecondly that as he hath ſent them, ſo by him they muſt al againe be taken away, when and as ofte as he ſhall ſee good and expedient. Of
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:21193:124"/>this thing therfore we will now ſpeak.</p>
                     <p>It eaſeth indeed ſomewhat the greatnes of the pains, in that the afflicted perſons are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, to hope for deliuerance at all times out of their diſtreſſes from God: but I wote not how it commeth to paſſe, their patience is very little holpen by this meanes at that very time, wherein their paines doo ſtill diſquiet them. For inaſmuch as hope reſpecteth things to come, and of theſe there remaineth alwaies ſome doubtfulnes, at the leaſt this can neuer fullye be plucked away: the minde cannot by reaſon of the greatnes of the calamities pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſo look into the commodities abſent, but that the aſſaultes of impatience will ofttimes returne a freſh, and by little and little wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrong, will at the length preuaile, in ſuch wiſe that he which is diſtreſſed with anguiſh, ſhall ſuppoſe himſelfe to be vtterly neglected of God, and againe he alſo for his part ſhall neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect all duety vnto God. To the which poynte when a man is once come, what hope can he haue any more? Leaſt any man therefore ſhould fall into this extreme miſerye of all miſeries, it ſhalbe very requiſite for him to knowe, that euen troubles and afflictions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo are ſent of God himſelfe, &amp; that as well for iuſt cauſes and conſiderations, as alſo for our

Which knowledge, is in very déed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fountaine and welſpring of al conſolation. For why, except y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> minde of euery diſtreſſed perſon be perſwaded, and that throughly, that it is ſo: there will ſcarce appéer any way of recouering either patience or comfort. There is no doubt, but the holy Fathers, as oft as they ſeeing the ungodly wel dealt withall, and themſelues to haue ill ſucceſſe in all thinges, ſuſpected that they were forſaken of God (for there are in the holy Scriptures ſuch complaintes extant) did againſt theſe temptations fortifie and confirm themſelues againſt diſtruſtfulnes with this doctrine of Gods prouidence. Wherfore the ſame alſo ought to be common vnto vs, and in the like troubles we muſt gather from thence the like comforts and conſolations.</p>

Neither in very deed are al the creatures to be accounted any other then the tooles and weapons of the cheefe woorkmaiſter God, and ſecond cauſes.

                     <p>Wherfore ſeeing it is in no wiſe lawfull to reſiſt his will, and that we are to take in good part, whatſoeuer he ordeineth by his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: we ought from hence to drawe ſome portion of comfort, in that we know aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that all perils and dangers come from God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>As touching the third reaſon, conſider the ſayinges of the holy fathers, weigh the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which propound vnto vs any that haue béene afflicted, whither of the godly or vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and vndoubtedly thou ſhalt finde, that ther by dooth redound vnto God the praiſe either of wiſdome or iuſtice, or rather of both of them togither. Touching the wiſdome of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>péering in our aduerſities, it is notably ſaid of <hi>Eſay. <hi>chap.</hi> 31. <hi>Woe vnto them that goe downe vnto</hi> Aegipt <hi>for helpe, and ſtaye vpon horſes, and truſt in Chariots becauſe they are many and in horſemen, becauſe they be very ſtrong: but they look not to the holy one of</hi> Iſraell, <hi>nor ſeek vnto the Lord.

                        </hi> Where the prophet reproueth thoſe that were ouermuch giuen and addicted to humane or carnall wiſoome, and admoniſheth them to look rather into Gods wiſdome, who dooth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without certaine aduiſe, and with like wiſdome both ſendeth and remoneth aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. For before the Lord dooth afflict any man
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:21193:132"/>with calamities, he reſolueth with himſelfe, what great good will grow of it either to him that ſuffereth, or vnto others, and likewiſe how and when it is expedient to deliuer the afflicted, to the great admiration of all men. <hi>Iob. 11. <hi>Oh that God would ſpeake, and open his lippes againſt thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he might ſhew thee the ſecrets of wiſdome, how thou haſt deſerued double according to right: know therfore that God hath forgotten thee for thine iniquitie.

But we ſhall better and more cleerely beholde in ſome one example the order of the diuine wiſdome. Doubtleſſe the hiſtory
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:21193:132"/>of the deſtruction of <hi>Egipt</hi> dooth many wayes declare the force and power of Gods wiſdome. God would not at the firſt deſtroy them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatlye after the contempt of his woord, which yet he iuſtly might haue doone: but it pleaſed him firſt to try them diuers and ſundry waies, whither by ſcourges they might be ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened and brought to the acknowledgement of his will: inſomuch that as ofte as new ſignes were ſent againſt the <hi>Egiptians,</hi> ſo ofte the Lord declared, that he earneſtly ſought their repentance and ſaluation. But in the meane while where in the middeſt of the vniuerſall ruines of all <hi>Egipt,</hi> the land of <hi>Goſhen,</hi> which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did poſſeſſe, remained ſafe and ſound, that verily auayled not a little to moue aſwell the <hi>Egiptians</hi> as the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> thoſe I ſay, that they might acknowledge the will of God, and ſubmit themſelues vnto it: and theſe, that they might waite with an vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable faith and pacience for a wonderfull deliuerance at Gods hand. And therfore alſo would the Lord haue <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to perſiſt and continue ſo long in ſtubbernes and vnbeleefe, that he might ſo much the more iuſtlye after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward deſtroy both him and all his. And in all theſe thinges the wiſdome of God dooth won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully bewray it ſelfe. To ſay nothing that
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:21193:133"/>theſe thinges were thus ordeined of the Lord, to the end poſteritic might haue profitable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples both of the puniſhment of incredulitie and rebellion, and of the commendation of faith and obedience. It would be ouerlong to make mention of all other thinges, that doo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll the diuine wiſdome of God in that hiſtory. And who is he that knoweth for a ſuretye the Lords purpoſes and determinations? Who is able to ſay, why or wherfore, when he could many other waies haue deliuered his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet he would this way eſpecially bring it to paſſe? Certaine it is in the meane ſeaſon, that nothing was doone in all this baſines without great and iuſt cauſes, but the nature of Gods wiſdome will more fullye open and diſplaye it ſelfe, whileſt other cauſes of afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions alſo are ſéene into, and eſpeciallye the commodities, wherof we will ſpeake anon. And as we (by the waye) in this one example doo propound theſe woorkes of Gods wiſdome to be obſerued, ſo will it be an eaſie matter for eueryman to finde out the like in other exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Wherfore it is manifeſt heerby, that the wiſdome of God ſhineth moſt cléerelye in our afflictions and dangers, and therfore that the calamities alſo which are laide vpon vs, are rightly to be aſcribed onely and alone to God

Now that the iuſtice of God is declared in our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, it is better known then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it needeth to be proued any whit at large. Gods iuſtice is eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where commended in the holy Scriptures, and it is ſet before vs to be conſidered all our life long. Hitherto belong all the places that make mention of the feare of God.

Adde alſo all the threatninges which are moſt plentifully extant in the lawe and the prophets againſt the tranſgreſſors of the Diuine preceptes. Yea and ſo farrefoorth is this knowledge of Gods iuſtice neceſſarye, that vnleſſe the ſame be diligentlye taught, men cannot, ſuch is their proneneſſe and head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong boldeneſſe to ſinne, be kept and retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned within the compaſſe of their dueties.

                     <p>Firſt, this woord Iuſtice commeth to be conſidered, not altogither alike in God, as it is in men, that namely God ſhould then only be acknowledged to be iuſt, when after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rule of mans iudgement, and according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rigor of the law (as they call it) hée requireth like for like (for otherwiſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> praiſe of iuſtice ſhould neuer properly belong vnto God, ſith he neuer in ſuch wiſe either giueth rewards or inflicteth puniſhments, but that in theſe he recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth beneath meaſure and deſart, and in thoſe aboue meaſure and deſart) but God dooth iuſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, as oft as he performeth that, wherein his wiſdome, goodnes and power doo appéere: inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as there is no man but vnderſtandeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is moſt iuſt, that theſe vertues (if at leaſt it be lawfull ſo to call them) ſhould at all times be made knowen and ſet foorth. But certes in
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:21193:135"/>the afflictions of the godly the wiſdome, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and power of God doo wunderfully declare and ſhewe foorth them ſelues: wherfore there is no cauſe why wee ſhould think that the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are vniuſtly puniſhed. Neither verily can wiſdome or goodnes as they are diſcearned in God, be ſeparated from iuſtice, for they ſticke faſt togither and helpe one an other, and can neuer be ſeuered in time or duties. For why? God dooth at all times woorke wiſely, mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wel and iuſtly: and whatſoeuer is doon wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, mightily or well, the ſame alſo muſt bée doon tuſtly: and ſo on the contrary.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, how canſt thou ſay that the god <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>y are wrongfully puniſhed, when there is no man endued with ſuch a ſinguler ſanctimonie, but that, if wée beleeue the Scripture (as dout leſſe wée muſt beleeue it) hée dooth not only fall once but alſo ſeuen nay infinit times in a day, yea and now &amp; then alſo hee committeth moſte greeuous enormities at leaſt wiſe in minde and will (which onely and alone maketh men guil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie before God, and is reputed and taken for the deed doon) further there is no ſinne ſo light &amp; woorthy of pardon to mans thinking, which yet were not to be recompenced with moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rible and eternall paines, if ſo be God would ſtraightly examine euery thing, and ſiſt it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:21193:135"/>the rule of his moſt ſeuere iudgement: For we are all by nature the children of wrath: <hi>Epheſ. 2.</hi> All haue ſinned and are deſtitute of the glory of God: <hi>Rom. 3.</hi> And <hi>Pſal. 130. <hi>If thou Lord wilt marke our iniquities, who ſhalbe able to ſtand?</hi>
                        </hi> Howſoeuer therfore it falleth out vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe that are accounted in the number of the godly, it behoueth them certes to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, yea euen whileſt they are diſtreſſed with ſtrange and innumerable perplexities, that they are yet louinglye and fauourablye delt withall. The Lord euen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when he ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth is pitifull and forgetteth not his mercy.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly: If in cace thou haſt experience dayly of the Lordes liberalitie, why ſhouldeſt thou not ſomtimes alſo feele his rodde? This thing no man will iudge to be vnequall, which at leaſt would not incurre the reproache of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, or take vpon him to controll Gods iuſtice.

                     <p>Fourthly: What ſhal we ſay to this? that it is meet and conuenient that parents ſhould ſomtimes correct their Sonnes, whome they
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:21193:136"/>would haue to become good men. And except they doo this, they ſhalbe thought to haue ſmall care or regarde of their childrens wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. After the ſame maner God alſo, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Father of vs all, dooth moſt iuſtlye, in that he euer and anon ſomewhat ſeuerelye chaſtiſeth the godly, whom he accounteth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedlye as his owne Children, leaſt they ſhould by ouermuch cockering become careles and ſecure, and being corrupted through long proſperitie fall to ſinning, with the wicked, who haue all thinges for the moſt parte accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their deſire.

                        </hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fiftly: Why ſhouldſt thou think much to be afflicted héere for a while, if after thou be gone from hence, thou knoweſt aſſuredly that eternall life is prepared for thée, and that thou ſhalt be bleſſed with ioyes euerlaſting? Nay it is iuſt and to be wiſhed, that thou ſhouldeſt ſuffer héer and be moleſted, that thou mighteſt héereafter enioy perpetuall reſt and felicitie. For why it cannot be, that all thinges ſhould fall out alike, after thy deſire both heere and there. For God hath ſo ordained. <hi>2. Theſ. 1. <hi>It is a righteous thing with God to render vnto
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:21193:136"/>you that are troubled reſt with vs, when the Lord Ieſus ſhall ſhewe him felfe from heauen.</hi>
                        </hi> And <hi>Luk. 16. Abraham</hi> ſaith to the rich man: <hi>Sonne, remember that thou in thy life time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuedſt thy pleaſures, and likewiſe <hi>Lazarus</hi> paines: but now is he comforted, and thou art tormented, &amp;c. <hi>1. Corinth. 11.</hi> When we are iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, we are chaſtened of the Lord, becauſe we ſhould not de condemned with the world.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Séeing therfore the afflictions that are ſent, doo commend Gods iuſtice vnto vs, we are to be perſwaded that they come not from God without cauſe. And héereby ſhall all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities become the more eaſie to be borne, in that we vnderſtand them to be iuſtly layde vpon vs, and that none ſo gréeuous can befall vs, but that we haue deſerued far more gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, if ſo be God ſhould weigh the greatnes of our ſinnes according to his iuſtice.</p>
                     <p>¶ Touching the fourth reaſon to ſpeak in few woords, namely that God by the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which he ſendeth vnto men, taketh occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to illuſtrate and ſet forth his owne power and glory, that becommeth manifeſt by the woordes of the Lord. <hi>Exod. 9.</hi> where a reaſon is rendred, why <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was ſo excéedinglye hardened, and ſo oftentimes moſt gréeuouſlye ſcourged with his people the <hi>Egiptians,</hi> for ſo
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:21193:137"/>ſaith the Lord by <hi>Moſes</hi> vnto <hi>Pharaoh: <hi>Let my people goe, that they may ſerue me. Otherwiſe I will at this time ſend all my plagues vpon thine hart, and vpon thy ſeruants, and vpon thy people, that thou maiſt know that there is none like me in all the earth.</hi>
                        </hi> And a little after: <hi>And in deed for this cauſe haue I appointed thee, to ſhewe my power in thee, and to declare my name in all the world.</hi> Which woordes we ſee to be repeated. <hi>Rom. 9.</hi> But wilt thou haue me tell thee more plainely, how the glorye of the Lord was aduanced by the afflictions of the <hi>Egiptians?</hi> Then conſider with thy ſelfe, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this thing dooth not make greatlye to the celebrating of the name &amp; power of the Lord, that he ſhooke ſo mighty a people, ſo quicklye, and by ſtrange meanes that were neuer heard the like, and at the length togither with their King and his whole armies vtterly deſtroyed them almoſt in a moment: Who would not heere honour and reuerence the wonderfull power of God, and acknowledge him to be the onlye God almightye reigning in heauen and in earth? But much more on the other ſide dooth the power of God ſhewe foorth it ſelfe in that ſo ſodaine and vnlooked for deliuerance of the people of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> which were ſo greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected and caſt downe: by reaſon whereof the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:21193:137"/>Lord alſo would afterward alwaies challenge to him ſelfe moſt ſoueraigne praiſe, repeating this oftetimes to <hi>Moſes</hi> and other of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: <hi>I am the Lord, which haue brought you out of the land of <hi>Egipt.</hi>
                        </hi> In like maner, if now alſo the Lord dooth one while erect, and an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while deiect Kinges and Kingdomes: or if ſo be he draweth thee at the laſt, who art in reſpect of thy body in very good health, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed with large poſſeſſions and honors, into ſicknes, or ſpoyleth thée of thy goods and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie thou oughteſt to iudge, that all this is doone to this end and purpoſe, that the Lord hath appointed in thée to ſet forth to the world his power to be ſéene, which againe he will make to appéere more glorious, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al things being now paſt hope of recouery, and all doo vtterly diſpaire of any helpe, he ſhall reſtore thée againe to thy former health, riches and dignitie, to the incredible admiration of all men. So in <hi>Iob,</hi> ſo in many others would the Lord haue his power to be ſéen, and dayly ſtill dooth he procure the like examples to be ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes, that it might alwaies be found true which the bleſſed Virgin ſang: <hi>The Lord hath ſhewed ſtrength with his arme, he hath ſcattered the proud in the imagination of their hartes. He hath put downe the mightye from
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:21193:138"/>their ſeate, and hath exalted the humble and meeke. He hath filled the hungrye with good thinges, and the rich he hath ſent empty away.</hi> Hitherto muſt it be referred, that holy men beeing plondged in perilles and dangers haue béene wont to pray vnto God, that he would deliuer them for his holy names ſake: that is to ſaye, that his glorye and power might by their maruailous deliuerance be aduanced, and celebrated of all people.</p>
                     <p>Now the fifth reaſon ſtretcheth moſt largelye of all other. The Holy ghoſt dooth euerye where in the ſacred Scriptures ſignifie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the great and manifolde vtilities which come by aduerſitie, which alſo the godlye doo with déep and aduiſed conſideration mark and obſerue, and chéefely they holde a true &amp; right opinion of Gods prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. It is not (I grant) euery mans caſe to perceiue and ſée by and by, how and after what ſorte croſſes and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are ſent for our good: but it behoueth vs to be enlightened in the ſpirit of our mind, and the cloudes of carnall cogitations to be ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and driuen away, before we can vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and knowe the ſpirituall commodities that are ſetled in our miſeries. For why: fleſh and blood or our reaſon ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not otherwiſe iudge, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that afflictions are ſignes of Gods wrath,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:21193:138"/>and that God when he ſtriketh ſéeketh our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and confuſion. Wherupon the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked can very hardly in this behalfe receiue any comfort, as the which, when they perceiue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the anger and diſpleaſure of God, doo rather curſſe and deteſt God as a cruell and inflexible iudge, then humble themſelues vnder his mightye hand in acknowledging their ſinnes. Wherby it commeth to paſſe that at length falling into diſpaire, whileſt they continually toſſe to and fro in their minde the ſignes of their ineuitable condemnation, they doo nothing els being drowned in the depthe of all euills, then perpetually heape one miſchéef vpon an other. We therfore will gather the commodities of afflictions out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, not all verily, but ſo many as we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly méete withall, and are moſt apparant, and which euen the vngodly for the moſt part, if they were touched with any care of their own ſaluation, and not vtterly blinded, might be able to perceiue.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>1</hi> Firſt: It is profitable that men ſhould ſomtimes be ſcourged of the Lord, to the end they might be humbled, and conteined in the dueties of modeſtie and temperance, and in no wiſe lifted vp by the reaſon of their other commodities, if they haue any. <hi>Pſal. 119. <hi>It is

And to the end he might declare and ſhewe, how and after what ſorte we ought to obſerue Gods prouidence and goodnes in all things, he propoundeth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine euident examples, to wit how ſome men are ſeene oftentimes by the will of God to be preſſed downe with moſt greeuous calamities, and the ſame againe, when they haue called vpon God for helpe, to be mercifully deliuered out of their miſeries. By means wherof doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe men may throughlye he perſwaded tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Gods prouidence and mercy, and ought all to be mooued to praiſe and magnifie God.

But much more cleerely will this whole

The firſt example is touching thoſe that are preſſed with pouertie, and béeing dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen out of their natiue cuntry are enforced to wander, and to ſuffer banniſhment: whome yet the Lord by his mercy ſuccoureth in proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them a place where they may reſt.

                     <p>If thou wouldeſt know the kinde of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or cauſe, then ſeeing that both in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and end, and oftetimes alſo in the middes we perceiue open and manifeſt exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and that all thinges tend to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, namely that men might be ſtirred vp to praiſe God for his excellent goodnes, ſhining moſt cleerely in all thinges, it is a plaine caco that this preſent Pſalme appertaineth to the kinde deliberatiue.</p>
                     <p>The ſtate or propoſition is generall: that God is highlye to be praiſed, becauſe he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly good, and maketh his goodnes to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount in all thinges.</p>
                     <p>The vſe of the Pſalme is manifolde, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly as may be obſerued in it ſundrye places fraughted with excellent doctrine: as: <hi>1.</hi> That calamities are ſent of God himſelfe: <hi>2.</hi> That

Many other places will we diſcouer in the diſcourſe it ſelfe. But to this end cheefly doo all theſe thinges tend, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they miniſter great ſtore of comfortes &amp; conſolations: which thing was the cauſe that moued vs to take in hand the interpretation of this Pſalm.

                     </p>
                     <p>This is the propoſition of the whole pſalm by way of an exhortation. <hi>God,</hi> ſaith he, is <hi>good, and his mercy is euery where excellent: therfore confeſſe ye vnto him, praiſe him, giue him thankes.</hi> And they are the woordes of the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:21193:149"/>Holy-ghoſt ſpeaking by the prophet to euerye company and aſſembly of the godly, wherſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and by what occaſion ſoeuer they ſhalbe gathered togither.

Let vs therfore ſo take theſe things, as though the Holy-ghoſt ſounded them in our hartes: and as though we felt his power ſecretly woorking in vs, let vs the more cheerefully ſing prayſes vnto God. Thus then he ſaith: <hi>Confeſſe vnto the Lord.</hi> Amongſt the Hebrues to confeſſe vnto the Lord, is to praiſe, celebrate, and with all carefulnes to commend the Lord, and to giue him thankes for his incomparable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites.</p>

After which manner alſo Chriſt taught vs to pray without intermiſſion, and to craue this eſpecially, that the name of his heauenlye

                     <p>
                        <hi>Let them ſpeake which are redeemed of the Lord, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the oppreſſor.</hi>) Let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeak, to wit, praiſe or a ſong of thankes giuing And whereas it is the part of al men and at al tunes to ſing prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes vnto God and to giue him thanks: yet is this duty chéefelye required of them, that haue taſted of his liberality and goodnes, and haue of him béene deliuered from moſt gréeuous pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilles and dangers.</p>
                     <p>All ſorts of men doo indéed féele dayly &amp; conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually Gods goodnes &amp; bountifulnes euen in this y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they liue, inaſmuch as it is of God that we haue our beeing, liue and moue, as he ſaith <hi>Act. 17.</hi> likewiſe that they doo dayly and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually beholde his Sunne ſhining: that they recetue from him the rayne in due ſeaſon, and the fruits of the earth wherwith they are ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined. But theſe thinges inaſmuch as they are vſuall and ordinary, are in ſuch wiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted off, as though the hand of God were not greatlye occupied in them, at the leaſt as though there were not heerein ſo plain a proofe and demonſtration of Gods goodnes. But we déem them moſt chéefely to ſeele in themſelues Gods bountye and liberalitie, which are fore vexed with diuers temptations and dangers,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:21193:151"/>and afterward notwithſtanding wonderfully deliuered. For why when we are in dangers we call vpon the Lord for helpe: and we can then at the length iudge what it is, to be either holpen of God or forſaken of God, when our hartes haue ſometimes béene ſmitten with the ſmart of trials and afflictions. And as no man knoweth how profitable a thing phiſick is, but he that hath ſometimes béene ſicke, and hath béene eaſed by it: nor of what valewe faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fréendes are, but he that hath beene brought to extreme néede, and taſted of their help: ſo none can ſufficiently comprehend, how great the goodnes of God is, but ſuch as haue beene tried, and deliuered by God out of the dangers of temptations. Wherfore to thoſe eſpecially dooth this Pſalme belong, that haue beene in ieopardy through ſundry trialles, and they can indeede iudge rightlye touching the vſe therof. We are wont to cal vpon God: and after that we haue obteined his help, it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vs to praiſe God, and to giue him thanks For this cauſe therfore he ſaith: <hi>Let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeak which are redeemed of the Lord.</hi> The woord <hi>Redeemed,</hi> noteth, that they were whollye come into the Lords hand and power by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the greatnes of benefites receiued, no otherwiſe then bought ſeruantes: and ſo all
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:21193:151"/>ſuch are admoniſhed, that they are debters vn to God, neither can they pretend any excuſe, why they ſhould not ſing praiſes to God: nay vnleſſe they doo it, they ſhall incurre the blame of moſt ſhamefull ingratitude. They that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were in the hand and power of the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor or of affliction, are now by the Lord deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, and they ought to be humbled vnder his mighty hand, and to giue him thanks, yea and to dedicate them ſelues wholye to God their deliuerer. All things therfore are trimly diſpoſed in this beginning and propoſition of the Plaſme, and we may gather from thence no ſingle or ſlender doctrine.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 <hi>And gathered them out of the lands, from the Eaſt and from the Weſt, from the North and from the South.</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. <hi>They wandred in the wildernes out of the way, and found no citie to dwell in.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Now after the propoſition followeth a plentifull confirmation, as in the which it is proued by many plaine and pithy reaſons, that
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:21193:152"/>God dooth liberally ſhewe his goodnes in mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall mens matters, and moſt wiſelye gouerne all thinges by his wonderfull prouidence, and therfore moſt worthy to be exceedingly praiſed and magnified of al men. This is the firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon prouing Gods goodnes to ſhine cleerelye in all thinges, taken from an example, as alſo all the reſt are in a manner that followe. And certes it is drawen from y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> example of a thing boone not only once and about one perſon only, but ofte times and in many perſons vſuallye ſéene: ſo that thou maiſt rightly ſay, that all theſe proofes are drawen out of the common courſe of life and from the vſe and experience of thinges dayly happening. Which kinde of proofes doubtles are moſt fit to moue affections withall, and beſides they make that to appeere moſt plaine which is intended. And it is to be thought, that no man, whatſoeuer he be, can poſſibly read this Pſalme, but that he ſhall ſinde ſome thing touching himſelfe, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may gather, that he alſo hath beene par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the bottomleſſe goodnes of God in ſome one neceſſitie or other. Neither truely is it an eaſie matter to finde ſuch a one, as hath not felt in himſelfe, ſome parte of the miſeries which are héere mentioned: and that, whileſt he is deliuered from them, ought not to aſcribe
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:21193:152"/>his preſeruation only and alone to God. Yea and there can no diſcommoditie or danger al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ariſe, which is not comprehended vnder ſome one or other of the thinges that are héere deſcribed, at the leaſtwiſe it will be like it or not much vnlike: wherfore alſo whoſoeuer is diſtreſſed with any aduerſities, ſhall héer haue ſome remedie of comfort, and ſhall finde mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of hope for the recouering of his ſafetie.</p>
                     <p>This is alſo further to be marked, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerye of the proofes are ſo diſpoſed, that they may fitly be deuided into two partes: wherof in the former are deſcribed the perilles which happen vnto men, in the latter is declared how they are by the mercy of God deliuered from the ſame: againe in the former parte the perils are very exquiſitly and almoſt after a poeticall manner expreſſed by increaſments, amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and repreſentings of things: and in the latter parte the deliuerance beeing ſodainlye and without any adoo obtained is laid ſoot the more breefely, yet hauing now and then thoſe thinges interlaced which doo not a little beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie and illuſtrate the matter. And ſo are all thinges ordered, that a man aduiſedlye mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them may out of euery member in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner gather variable and moſt holſome doctrine.</p>
                     <p>This firſt proofe therfore is drawen from
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:21193:153"/>the example of thoſe that for any cauſe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>euer being driuen from their dwelling places are conſtrained to wander vp and downe, and to ſéek a place elſ where wherin they may reſt. And very properly is the ieopardy of theſe men deſcribed by their iourney in the deſert, then the which doubtles a greater could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed. For why? a man would hardly beléeue (except he be one that hath had triall of it) how greatly they are gréeued that wander in the wildernes, where there appéereth no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane help or ſuccour, and nothing to be looked for but death and deſtruction. And therfore it is to be thought that certaine of the <hi>Greekes</hi> were moued to make a lawe touching a penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of death to be laide vpon him that would not ſhe we the way to one that went aſtraye, becauſe they ſawe vndoubtedly how ſore they were torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted that wandred out of the way. And oftetimes into theſe dangers doo men fall in <hi>Paleſtina</hi> and the cuntries next adioyning, in aſmuch as all <hi>Aſia</hi> for the moſt parte hath many deſerts and obſcure places, as the holy Scripture and bookes of the <hi>Geographers</hi> doo te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Their ſoule fainted (or failed) in them.)</hi> Héere thou ſéeſt the manner of an enlargment gallantly obſerued. Firſt euen to ſtraye out of
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:21193:153"/>the way, is full of weariſomneſſe, though it be in a Cuntry well knowen. Then to goe ſtil forth on, and not to finde a place where to reſt, is much more gréetious. After ward alſo to be pinched with hunger and thirſt, who ſéeth it not to be the extremitie of all miſeries, and that now nothing remaineth but cruell and wofull death: And this is it which he addeth: <hi>Their ſoule fainted in them.</hi> We haue a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine reſemblance of theſe calamities pictured in <hi>Abrahams</hi> bondmaide <hi>Agar, Geneſ. 16.</hi> in the people brought out of <hi>Egipt</hi> through the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes, where they murmured for meate and drinke, <hi>Exod. 16.</hi> and <hi>17.</hi> in <hi>Dauid</hi> flying from <hi>Saul, Sam. 23.</hi> and <hi>25.</hi> againe <hi>2. Sam. 15.16,</hi> when he fled by reaſon of the tumult raiſed by <hi>Abſolon:</hi> likewiſe in <hi>Elias</hi> flying for the threats of <hi>Iezabell, 1. King. <hi>chap.</hi> 19.</hi> which all in their flight through deſert places were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt dead for hringer and thriſt.</p>
                     <p>But it is not without cauſe that the Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghoſt dooth ſo liuely painte out theſe perilles. For we ought thereby to gather ſome inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Firſt therfore it is doone to this ende and purpoſe, that we might learne how to behaus our ſelues towards thoſe that are in miſerie, and to pittie them whom we ſee to ſuffer ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:21193:154"/>to wander through vnknowen cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and to haue no freends to ſuccour them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that we might ſo much the more exactly weigh and conſider the power and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God in the preſeruation of them that are deliuered by him out of ſo great diſtreſſes. How much greater the dangers are, ſo much more fully doth Gode mercy thew it ſelf in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance from them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And they cryed vnto the Lord</hi>) The ſecond part of the prooſe touching their deliuerance. And this verſe is put betweene in manner of a <hi>parentheſis,</hi> as that which is oftetimes repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, almoſtin euery of the proofes following. So is this in <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgal:</hi> Begin my pipe with me to ſound Menalian verſes. And this: <hi>Leade <hi>Daphnis</hi> from the citie home, my verſes, leade him home.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And we learne out of this verſe: <hi>1,</hi> That afflictions ſent of God doo ſtirre vs vp to inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation &amp; prayer vnto God. Concerning which profit of aduerſities we haue ſpoken before. <hi>2.</hi> That God willingly heareth thoſe that pray in their afflictions, &amp; graunteth their tequeſts. Hitherto belong all the promiſes of God euery where extant: like wiſe the exhortations vnto prayer: alſo the ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>And he led them forth.</hi>) Then is it the Lord him ſelfe that leadeth them. The thing then is not doone by chaunce or fortune, neither is it by haphazard that a man ſtrayeth or retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth into the right way: but all thinges come to paſſe by the onely will and diſpenſation of the Lord. That thou goeſt out of the waye, that thou art in hazard and danger, it is the will of the Lord. He would be entreated of thee, and ſéeketh occaſion to deſerue well at thine hand, yea and to ſhewe his goodnes and mercye towardes thée. Therefore all theſe thinges fall out for the beſt vnto thée, and for thy comfort, neither ought any diſtruſtfulnes at all to come into thy minde.</p>
                     <p n="8">

                     <p>This is the concluſion of the firſte proofe, wherein he exhorteth all people, to ſing prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes vnto God for ſuch and ſo great goodnes of his, ſhewed and exhibited vnto men endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after that manner.

For whoſoeuer endeuering after true holines goe downe to the ſea, that is, into this worlde, intending to worke in great wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that is, to teach the people (for water ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niffieth the people) by word and example: ſuch men ſee y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> workes of the Lord, which the world léeeth not. In the meane time they are ſhaken with great temptations, ſo as now they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as it were hoyſed vp to the heauen, whilſt ouercomming their aduerſarye they fixe their hope on high in heauenly thinges, &amp; are ſtrong in faith: and againe they deſcend into the deep, whilſt through the rage of their aduerſary the tempter, and the greatnes of troubles, they
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:21193:168"/>ſinck downe as it were into deſperation. And a long time do they continue in theſe dangers, ſo that there ſeemeth now no refuge or ſuccour to be left vnto them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But at length they call v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Lord, who allayeth the tempeſtes of temptations, ſéndeth them help and comfort, raiſeth them vp againe and ſtrengthneth them in faith, vntill at length they be brought to the hauen of eternall ſaluation. It liketh others to expound it onely of the gouerners of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to whome is committed the ſhippe of the Church to be gouerned: ſuch ſhip men were the Apoſtles, being made y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fiſhers of men. And ſuch do a worke in deed great &amp; difficult, whilſt they labour in many waters, that is to ſay in a great and mightye people to procure the things that belong to all their welfares and ſafetie. Theſe doo moſt deeply ſearch the works of the Lord, and obſerue his wonders. But immediatly the aduerſarye the deuill ſtirreth vp the harts of the wicked, which moue migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty tragedies and tempeſts, raiſe vp hereſies, offences, diſſentions and hurliburlies, ſo as the ſhip of the Church may ſéeme to be as good as drowned, and the godly miniſters the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues driuen almoſt to diſpaire. Thus the whole ſhip is ſhaken, but eſpecially the gouerners of the Church are ſo troubled, that there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:21193:169"/>no way or meane, wherby they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the doctrine, which with great labour and trauell they before had planted. But euen then the Lord being called vpon heareth both the Miniſters and the Church, he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the tempeſtes to be ſtill, he extinguiſheth the waues of perſecutions, the windes of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies and vaine doctrine, he ſcattereth the threatning ſtormes of ſtumbling-blockes and offences, finally he giueth to the Churches and their miniſters deſired peace and tranquilitie, and bringeth them all to the happye hauen of ſaluation where they would be. And as theſe thinges are ſpoken of the Miniſters of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woord which rule and gouerne the ſhip of the church, ſo may they not be vnfitly taken of the godlye Magiſtrates, which labour with their great perilles and dangers to maintaine ſound and ſincere religion. Yea and it is the common ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity of many: for why the Ship-men and Ship being in danger, it followeth of neceſſity that al they are in danger likewiſe that are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in in the ſame Ship.</p>
                     <p>But we for our partes will take all things ſimply, &amp; content our ſelues with a baſer ſenſe. This is therfore the fourth proof declaring the goodnes and mercy of God to be preeminent in all things, borrowed from the example of thoſe
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:21193:169"/>that ſayling by ſea, haue the perilles of ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke and drowning euery hour, what ſay I hour? nay more truely euerye minute of an hour before their eyes. Neither is this miſery a matter of ſmall importance or a thing rarely happening, but greater in very déed and more commonly ſéene then can either be expreſſed or beleeued, but of ſuch as haue had tryall of it: and therfore it is not without cauſe reckned heere amongſt the greateſt and moſt gréeuous dangers.</p>
                     <p>And the former part touching the dangers is heere more plentifully diſcourſed then in the other proofes before going: which appeereth eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially for this cauſe to be done, that ſuch as haue had no experience of them, could other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hardly be brought to vnderſtand what they meane. For ſuch men it was méete that the matter ſhould the more largely &amp; plainly bée deſcribed.

Againe on the other ſide God turned the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes into pooles of water, when the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were brought and receiued into the Kingdom, and became the people of God, receiuing the giftes of the Holy-ghoſt, and the Baptiſme of holeſome water. Moreouer God placed there the hungry: that is to ſaye, ſinners acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging their neceſſitie, hungring and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting after righteouſnes. Which prepared a Citie to dwell in: that is to ſay, they grew vp into the Church of God. And they ſowed, with the ſeed of Gods word the feelds of their harts. And they planted Viniardes, they gathered Churches in diuers places, or they became the true branches of the true Vine, which is Chriſt. And they brought foorth fruite of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall increaſe, whilſt euery man brought forth according to the meaſure of his giftes, ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all fruites, ſome thirtie folde, ſome ſixty folde, and ſome a hundred folde.

But afterward the ſame are againe dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and brought lowe, when namely they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now full, begin againe a freſhe to neglect and to loath the woord of God. Few are found to be truely godly, fewe to haue faith and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. There entred in pride and vaine glory, corrupt doctrine, hipocriſie, ſectes and ſchiſmes among themſelues, and ſo their Kingdome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deuided could no longer endure. Further the Lord poureth contempt vpon princes, that is to ſay, biſhops and doctors: For whileſt the world ſeeth them gaping after riches, pompe, pride and vaineglory, it beginneth alſo to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpize both them and their doctrine. Experience teacheth vs this. And ſo they themſelues won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in deſert places, out of the way. They are addicted to Philoſophie and to their owne ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and traditions, but as for the woord of God they haue vtterly neglected it, I will not ſay oppreſſed it.

<pb n="345" facs="tcp:21193:175"/>of the Church: and maketh them fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, litle Churches and diſperſed, as a flock of ſheepe, accounting them for lawfull aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, nay for his true and lawfull Church, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging in them his ſheepe, as they alſo acknowledge his voice. After this manner cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes may the Pſalme not vnaptlye be expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and indéed certaine excellent doctors of the Church haue expounded it, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Pomexan.</hi> In the meane ſeaſon <hi>Hierome</hi> and <hi>Arnobius,</hi> from that place wherein it is ſaid, <hi>And again they are diminiſhed &amp; brought lowe:</hi> haue a little otherwiſe proſecuted the ſence, namely as touching Martyrs, by whoſe afflictions the number of the faithfull is dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, whileſt for feare of paines and torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts many ſhrink from the faith and from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church. But afterwards the tiranto and perſecutors beeing againe humbled by God and brought into contempt, the poore are againe deliuered, that they may freely and without feare praiſe God in the Church. But the former expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is much better in my iudgement. After this ſorte therfore doo many interpret this part of the Pſalme touching the calling of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and ſtate of the church gathered of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> inſomuch that they haue alſo prefixed this title to the whole Pſalme, namelye that

It hath liked others to affirme, that this Pſalm preacheth of Chriſt and of the people by him redéemed, and of the Synagoge to be conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto Chriſt.</p>

                     <p>THeſe things had I in a readines againſt the infinite rankes of euils and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that now range openly in the world, to miniſter by way of comfort, to all the afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but eſpecially to the godlye and ſuch as feare God. And forſomuche as we ſawe the place touching Gods prouidence to be moſt profitable for the rayſing of fitte matter and furniture of comforts, we haue taken in hand to vnfolde this, vtterly omitting all other of the ſame ſorte whatſoeuer. And firſt of al we haue declared by way of teaching, what is properlye to be vnderſtoode by the name of Gods prouidence: and that there is a proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, we haue proued by many cleere and forcible reaſons, confuting thoſe things that might ſéem to be brought to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary. Next we haue ſhewed wherin Gods deuine proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence differeth from the foreknowledge, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination and wiſdome of God: and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we haue proued that prouidence is not
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:21193:188"/>onely vniuerſall, as many ſuppoſe, but alſo ſpeciall and particular, again diſpatching all thoſe things, which we ſuſpected might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected by the defenders of the contrary parte. Then from hence we procéeded to teache and declare, that neither fate or deſtinie ought to be auouched, nor chaunce or fortune nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingens or haphazard to be graunted, where the due knowledge of Gods prouidence is, and the ſame woorthilye weighed and eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Laſtly alſo we haue diſcuſſed this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, namely whither Gods prouidence dooth bring neceſſitie to thinges prooued or no. Which points thus handled and diſcourſed, we came to the ſecond parte of our woorke, and ſhewed at large, and as far foorth as the method of our matter ſeemed to require, that al the things which were taught by vs of and concerning Gods prouidence, auayled verye much aſwell to manye other ſpirituall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as alſo eſpecially to the fetching of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortes from thence againſt all kinde of perils and dangers whatſoeuer. Laſt of all we haue added alſo a Pſalme, preaching moſt plainely and plentifully aſwell of Gods prouidence, as alſo of the comforts to be looked for from the ſame. It remaineth that you my good brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto whom theſe petie matters of ours ſhall
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:21193:188"/>come, doo rightlye vſe them, and apply them, as much as is poſſible, to your benefite and commoditie. I doubt not, but many might haue put foorth better things: and I dare be bolde to ſay this, that we alſo could without any great difficultie haue brought many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges fitte for our purpoſe: but theſe ſame things I hope, I had almoſt ſayde I am ſure and certain, will miniſter great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding profit to godly mindes, and I truſt will ſatiſfie all thoſe that being carried with no curioſitie, haue learned at leaſt to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with meane and meaſurable matters.</p>
                     <p>And to the intent that all men might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace theſe things with the more cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of minde, it were conuenient to adde too ſome things touching the profitablenes and neceſſitie of the knowledge of Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: but for the godly I am perſwaded this thing is not greatly néedfull: and as for the reſt it is better y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> experience ſhould perſwade this matter vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (whileſt they ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in the time of their troubles that by the conſideration of Gods prouidence, woorking all in all, they are ſomewhat eaſed of their greefs) then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhould be brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it by a certain eagernes of ſpeech. This can I ſay bréefly with our <hi>
                           <hi>Pſalmiſt.</hi> He that is
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:21193:189"/>wiſe, and rightly enſtructed in the knowledg of Gods prouidence, will obſerue and marke all thoſe things that he ſeeth to come to paſſe in this world, by the wil of the Lord: &amp; vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly he ſhal vnderſtand, that euen in al the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities which are ſent the ſingular mercye and goodnes of God do ſhine and appeere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which doubtleſſe is ſuch a thing, as the minde may ſafely reſt vpon it. In ſumme, I dare be bolde to ſay, that the true bleſſednes, ſo farfoorth as maye bee obteined in this life, is ſetled in the knowledge of Gods prouidence: on the other ſide that he that is ignorant of this, can neuer haue any thing wherwith aſſuredly to comfort himſelfe, and therfore is plundged in extreme miſery. Nay he ſcarſely perceiueth himſelfe to be a man that is not carried with the care of a more neere knowledge of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it behoueth, before I make an end of ſpeaking, to adde in two or thrée woordes (as they ſay) ſomewhat touching the true vſe of ſuch diuine comfortes, as we haue heaped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither in this place. So ought they to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as that they may procreate and beget in vs other ſpirituall fruites alſo: that is to ſay, we muſt in no wiſe be made ſecure by them, ſo as we ſhould vtterly ſhake off al feare: and much leſſe muſt we be hardened in our harts,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:21193:189"/>and conceiue as it were a Stoicall indolency in our mindes, or through a long cuſtome in euilles be brought into a forgetfulnes of God: but we muſt be ſtirred vp to patience, wherby we may take in good part Gods good will and pleaſure towardes vs: we muſt be ſtirred vp unto faith, wherby we may praiſe him, and call vpon him for his helpe for our deliuerance, and at length being holpen giue him alſo thanks. This ought to be the tiue and lawfull end of all diuine conſolations, to the which end we alſo haue put foorth theſe things. And héewithall ſhalbe cloſed vp our preſent diſcourſe, only this will we repeate with the Apoſtle, and let vs imprint it moſt déepely &amp; continually in our mindes, <hi>2.

                     <p>Sithence then it is chéefelye entreated héer of Peace, as may appeer by that, which we haue already ſaid: Firſt leaſt we ſhould ſtray from the purpoſe, we are to know that the name of Peace is diuerſelye taken in the holye Scriptures. But moſt commonly it is taken for that peace of minde or conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whereby was beeing reconciled with God through Chriſt, doo reſt in him, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our ſelues that God is a fréend and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnto vs for Chriſts ſake, with whome we are ioyned through a true and liuelye faith.

                        </hi> ſaith he, <hi>by faith, are at peace with God.</hi> But of this peace it is not properlye meant in this place: but rather of a certaine effecte thereof, that is to ſay, of that concord and agreement of mindes,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:21193:196"/>wherewith the faithfull béeing tyed and linked among themſelues doo liue, not hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but deſiring alwayes to profite one an other: and declyning all occaſions of Warres, braules, and ſtrifes, which doo ſpring from the luſtes of the Fleſhe, and ſtudying continuallye for peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.

                     <p>But this firſt woord, <hi>Beholde,</hi> is empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall or forcible, and ſeemeth to conteyne a certaine oppoſition of thinges diſagreeable. For the Prophet would ſhewe openlye to the people both the ſtates: namely, that troubleſome eſtate, wherein the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had long liued: and the peaceable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which they then enioyed. For the things
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:21193:197"/>that are thus compared togither doo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more cleere and euident. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when hee ſaith, <hi>Beholde how good and how ioyefull a thing it is, brethren to dwell togither in vnitie,</hi> the King calleth his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes to remembraunce of the former war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res and the inconueniences thereof, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they had now a long time béene toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and turmoyled, and exhorteth them to compare the ſame with the peacible ſtate and condition, wherein they then liued. For why? none doo knowe better the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modityes and diſcommodities of Peace and Warre, then thoſe that haue liued in bothe eſtates. Preferring therefore peace before warre, and ſhewing the commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof as it were with his finger, he ſayth, <hi>Beholde, how good and pleaſant a thing it is, to enioye peace and tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</hi>

For often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that which is good, is not ſo pleſant, but bitter and ſharpe. But in Peace and brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concord, this hath no place: for this is both good and pleſant. And what is there I praye you, which is either good or pleaſant in warre, or in ſtrifes and braulinges? Verily nothing: but Peace and brotherlye loue, that is to ſay, Charitie comprehendeth both good I ſay, and pleſant. And yet notwithſtanding heere is not commended euery Peace and concord, but that which is eſtabliſhed &amp; confirmed among brethren. Therfore the prophet ſaith expreſly, that it is good and pleſant, for brethren, which acknowledge and reuerence one God their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to imbrace and kéepe peace among them ſelues.

                        <hi>Aaron</hi> was the firſte high préeſte among the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> euen as the <hi>Latines</hi> of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> doo call all their Emperours <hi>Caeſars,</hi> that is to ſay, Emperours.</p>
                     <p>But it is well knowne out of the holye Scriptures, that the high Preeſtes in times paſt among the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were annointed with Oyle, when they were conſecrated, as ſaith <hi>Moſes Exod. 29.</hi> And that externall oyle, was a ſigne or token of the heauenly giftes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God adorned them to the executing of their function. Which oyle, beeing moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, was in ſuch plenty poured on the head of the high Preeſt, that it ran down to his beard, yea euen to the ſkirtes of his clothing, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he was al ouer beſineared and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed with it. And ſo great was the ſmel, and ſo pleſant the odour of ſo precious an ointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that all that were preſent, were after a ſorte alſo perfumed therewith. Naye further this belonged to the whole people of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> whoſe Préeſt was annointed in the behalfe of all the people, to the end that he being accepted with God, might reconcile the people vnto him, and conſecrate them by his miniſtrie. And all theſe thinges were a certain ſhadowe and figure of Chriſt, and of all Chriſtians. For Chriſt was annointed, not (perdy) with that external and
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:21193:199"/>viſible oyle, but with an other, to wit, a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly, &amp; the ſame by infinite degrees more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious then the former. Therfore <hi>Dauid, Pſal. 45.</hi> ſaith, <hi>that he was annointed with the oyle of gladnes aboue his fellowes.</hi> For why? he was endued with the Holy-ghoſt aboue mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: Yea <hi>the fulnes of the Godhead dwelte in him verily and indeed,</hi> and, <hi>in him are all the treaſures of knowledge and wiſdome,</hi> as <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> of which giftes he maketh all thoſe partakers, that draw ny vnto him by faith. For to this end receiued he thoſe things of the Father that he might communicate the ſame vnto vs, which alſo he moſt willinglye dooth, as béeing moſt deſirous of our ſaluation. This Oyle therefore runneth downe from Chriſt the head, firſte to the beard, that is to ſay, to the Prophets, Apoſtles, Paſtors, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, then alſo to the whole body, ſo as there is no part or member therof, which is not wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and moiſtened with it. For it goeth downe euen to the very border of his garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For why? he endueth vs with his holy ſpirit, to the end that béeing made one with him, we might be partakers of all his benefites, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially of his righteouſnes, which he beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth on vs, in pardoning and forgiuing al our ſinnes, that being fréede and deliuered from
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:21193:200"/>Satan, the world, and the luſtes of the fleſhe, we might ſerue him purely and ſincerelye all the daies of our life. And from hence dooth ſpring that Peace and concord, which is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated of in this place. For why? if we be ſo engraffed into the body of Chriſt, that we are his members, how ſhould we diſagrée among our ſelues? how ſhould there be broyles, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treds, and contentions amongſt vs? And if there be any, that are delighted with warres, braulinges, and diſagreements (as doubtleſſe there are ouer many ſuch in theſe our dayes) then ſith it manifeſtly appeereth that they doo contemne this moſt precious ointement, nay they tread Chriſt himſelf, and his blood, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were waſhed, vnder their fate, we ought in no wiſe to followe their example: but among vs there ought to be one minde, one wil, and one conſent, becauſe we are all ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled with one ointement, and members of one Chriſte.

Therfore by theſe two ſimilitudes is declared and ſet foorth, that which was ſaide in the firſt verſe, that peace and concord is a good and a pleſant thing, to the end we might be the more ſtirred vp to imbrace it, and euermore to hold it faſt amongſt vs. As therefore the hilles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of moiſture, except they be watered with the dewe of heauen, muſt of neceſſitie wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and waxe daye: euen ſo, vnleſſe men doo woorſhip God according to his will, and doo nouriſh peace alſo among themſelues, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be but that they ſhalbe like a feelde that is withered, and deſtitute of all moyſtenes. For why? except this thing be propounded as a principle in the firſte place, the whole life of man muſt of neceſitie, become wretched and miſerable. For by diſcordes all thinges are maſted and conſumed. Nay this Similitude declareth, that vnleſſe we doo with all care and diligence, labour and indeuer after peace, we cannot doo any thing, that is pleaſing to God, neither diſcharge our duetie to men. And ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore, if ſo be we would pleaſe God aright, if ſo be we deſire to profit our cuntry, from whence we are, and the Church, and to liue a godlye and pleaſant life, wee muſt labour to come to this point, that being watered with this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:21193:201"/>dewe, we may ſéeke and enſue Peace, which will bring all theſe commodities with it. Except therefore we wilbe content to be as fruitleſſe and barren groundes, and to leaue off the execution of our charge and function, let vs loue and make much of peace.</p>
                     <p>There remaineth now the reaſon, which is the foundation of the whole Pſalme. <hi>For God</hi> ſaith he, <hi>poureth plentifullye his bleſsing vpon thoſe, that tender and regarde Peace, and rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them with eternall life.</hi> For why? if the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if it fall out otherwiſe, and that this moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred agreement of thinges among themſelues be interrupted and broken, then will followe foorthwith a horrible confuſion &amp; deſſolation of all things. If the Heauen anſwer not the expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Earth, if the Earth tilled by mans labour, ſhould diſapoint y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> huſbandman of his hope, we muſt of neceſſitie periſhe for
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:21193:205"/>hunger. If any humor preuailing and ſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in vs, ſhould deſtroye and conſume the reſt: therby would diſeaſes firſt, and then death immediatly follow. If in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale the poorer be oppreſſed of the richer, the weaker of the ſtronger: or if ſuch as be in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, refuſe to beare the yoake of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: if in the Church, if in the Vniuerſitie they that rule, rule not well: or, if others ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not themſelues to be ruled by reaſon, as in a houſholde or familie, then will there followe foorthwith of neceſſitie ruine and deſtruction. For no leſſe true alſo is this, that <hi>By diſcorde great thinges are diminiſhed and brought to nought.</hi> Which ſaying Chriſt himſelfe cenfir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, when he ſaith: <hi>Euery kingdome deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt it ſelfe, and euery houſe deuided, ſhalbe deſolate.</hi> For as by Concord ſmall things doo growe, ſo by Diſcord great things decay, and at length come to naught.</p>
                     <p>Sith then theſe things are thus, right déer and welbeloued brethren (for there is none of vs all that makes any queſtion of the trueth of this matter) it is our partes and duties al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, and with all care and diligence, as much as in vs lyeth, to keepe and retain peace both among our ſelues, and with all men.

Doctor <hi>Chaderton,</hi> I haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vpon me the charge of this daies Sermon wherin God ſo aſſiſting, I am to expound the <hi>15.</hi> Pſalme, which you, my déer brethren, haue
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:21193:207"/>heard me now to read. The author of this Pſalme, as appéereth by the title, is <hi>Dauid,</hi> a man in <hi>Iſraell,</hi> that is to ſay in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, moſt famous and excellent, as he that was King of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> and a notable Prophet of God, and in many other reſpectes alſo, a tipe and figure of Chriſt himſelf. And therefore this Pſalme is worthily commended vnto vs by the Author of it, to the end we might be the more héedfull to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the things, that ſhalbe propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſo rare a man, and to tranſfer them to the vſe of our life: eſpeciallye ſith he, beeing taught by the Holy-ghoſt, had and wrot theſe things for all our enſtruction. There is alſo an other ſpeciall cauſe, where through we ought no leſſe to be moued, to ſhewe our ſelues at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue and teachable, namely for that <hi>Dauid</hi> in this place, dooth of purpoſe handle and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde a queſtion, which of all, that euer could be handled, is the weightieſt and moſt profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and that is, by what waies or meanes mortall men, may after this miſerable &amp; tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory life, atteine to the happy and bleſſed life eternall.</p>
                     <p>We doo all naturallye couet life, and that not of euery ſort, but bleſſed: and bleſſed it cannot be, except it be eternall. For if ſo be a man ſhould liue a life héere ſequeſtred from all
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:21193:207"/>euils, and flowing with all manner of good thinges and delightes, and yet death continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally hang ouer his head, whereby he might be depriued of all thoſe thinges, how could he be bleſſed, being in a perpetuall feare of moſt weighty matters? And this ſo vehement a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre of eternall life, being graffed into men by God, declareth the immortalitie of our ſoules, and that there is another life, after this life, to come: for otherwiſe it ſhould be ſetled in men in vain. And therfore in this point almoſt all haue alwaies agreed, as appeereth by the bookes of the Philoſophers and Poets, which haue ſpoken and deuiſed many thinges, of the other life after this: but as touching the way, that leadeth vnto it, there haue alwaies been great and gréeuous contentions among men, ſome affirming one way to the wood, and ſome an other, and euery one with tooth and nayle maintaining their ſeueral opinions. And from hence haue hatreds, debates, perſecutions, warres, and ſo many horrible ſlaughters of men, both often beene broched in times paſt, and at this day are broached in many places, whileſt ech man will enforce other, to imbrace his opinion touching this matter. If there be any therfore, of ſo great credit and authoritie among all the reſt, that candecide this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:21193:208"/>touching the way to eternall life, which all doo ſo much couet, ſo as he may put an end to murders, warres, troubles, perſecutions, and lead men to the life, which they long for, without error: doubtleſſe he may ſeeme to be the only odde man of the world well worthye to be heard of al with moſt diligent attention. But <hi>Dauid</hi> ſeemeth to be ſuch a one, ſith it is manifeſt, that he was ſo notable a prophet of God, and a man ſo deere and acceptable vnto God. If ſo be therfore he hath at any time, or in any place, vttred his minde &amp; giuen ſentence touching this controuerſie, it ought to goe for payment, and no more doubt to be made of it, then of a heauenly Dracle. But ſurelye he in this Pſalme, medling with an other matter, taketh vpon him of purpoſe to ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Therefore let vs with cleere and reſolute mindes heare him, expounding this matter vnto vs.</p>
                     <p>In the firſte verſe of this Pſalme, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth the Queſtion: and being propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he then after vnfoldeth in the verſes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, and finallye concludeth it in the laſt
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:21193:208"/>Thus then he putteth it foorth, <hi>O Lord who ſhall dwell in thy Tabernacle?</hi> and thus by and by with a greater vehemencie, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peateth to the greater attention, though in woordes ſomewhat altered, ſaying, <hi>Who ſhall reſt in thy holy Hill?</hi> And this thus propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he layeth out afterward by many effects, in this ſorte: <hi>Euen he,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that walketh vprightly, and woorketh righteouſnes and ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the trueth from his hart: he that ſlaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not with his tung, nor dooth euill to his neighbour, nor receiueth a falſe reporte againſt his neighbour: he that ſetteth not by a vile per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but honoreth them that feare the Lord: he that ſweareth, and carefullye performeth his othe: he that neither giueth his money to Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nor peruerteth iudgementhy taking reward.</hi> Thus the queſtion béeing decided he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. <hi>He that dooth theſe things,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall neuer be caſt out of the houſe of God.</hi> Now the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is manifeſt, which we ſaide, that <hi>Dauid</hi> in this place vndertaketh of purpoſe to handle, and vnfold this Queſtion. Therfore it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that we harken vnto him with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, to the end, we may perceiue what he ſaith, and what his meaning is: for which cauſe, we will now proſecute euery thing ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more at large.</p>
                     <pb n="408" facs="tcp:21193:209"/>
                     <p>The Queſtion he propoundeth firſt of all with a certaine exclamation, to the intent, he might bewray y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greater affection of his minde and ſtirre vs vp the more to attention: but he propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth it (which might ſeem very ſtrang) not to men, as he ought to haue doone, but to God. <hi>O Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>who ſhall dwell in thy Tabernacle?</hi> becauſe men pervie in this cace are blind, and God is onlye the fit iudge. And therfore that this ſo weighty a queſtion might with the greater authortrie, be determined, <hi>Dauid</hi> would diſpute it in the preſence of God himſelfe, and before his iudgement ſeat, that we might be giuen to vnderſtand, that the thing which is heere vttered, is the certaine, vndoubted Oracle of God. For this cauſe therefore, letting men goe, who are too too much blind-folded, eſpeciallye in this matter he calleth God him ſelf to witnes, or rather to be the iudge of this controuerſy, as if he ſhould ſay: O God, I now appeale vnto thée, that thou being my witnes and iudge, I may teach men, which is the certaine and vndoubted way to eternall life, touching the which all men vpon earth doo ſo greatlye ſtriue among themſelues, all generally coueting to haue it, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greteſt number going aſtray from it. And we are to mark, that in both the members of
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:21193:209"/>this firſt verſe, <hi>Dauid</hi> ſetteth before vs the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly and bleſſed life in the Tabernacle, and in mount <hi>Syon.</hi> For he dooth not demaund, who ſhall one day enioy euerlaſting life in hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen: but who ſhall dwell in the Tabernacle, that <hi>Moſes</hi> had erected among the <hi>Iſraelits:</hi> and abide in that holy Mountaine. But all is one in effect. For why? that Tabernacle, and that mount <hi>Syon</hi> was a figure of the heauenly Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, and of eternall life, as appéereth by infinit places of the holy Scriptures. And that this is ſo to be vnderſtood, may appéer by that, that, if he had ment only of the outward Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle and Mount, he would not haue aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, who ſhould dwel in them: For they were appointed to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and it was lawfull for all, aſwell good as bad, to be conuerſant in them. But <hi>Dauid</hi> putting a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce between the good and the euill, and reſpecting the end of the Tabernacle erected, &amp; conſidering mount <hi>Syon</hi> after a ſpirituall manner, demaundeth who ſhall reſt and abide there. For he that by faith frequented that Tabernable and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, was ſure to be partaker of the life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and heauenly, whereof theſe were tipes and figures on earth. Therfore it is all one as if he had expreſſely demaunded, who ſhould be partaker of eternall life.</p>
                     <pb n="410" facs="tcp:21193:210"/>
                     <p>Which Queſtion afterward he expoundeth at large, that is to ſay, by eleuen ſundrye ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects drawen from him that earneſtlye ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth after the ſame bleſſed life. Euerye of which are of vs to be weighed, but yet ſo, as, hauing regarde of the place and time, we may bréefelye teach them, which otherwiſe if the time would ſuffer, were well worthye to be longer ſtoode vpon.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt verſe therfore, wherin he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to vnfolde the queſtion, he ſaith, that he ſhalbe partaker of the heauenlye life, that ſo long as he liueth, this ſhort and tranſitory life here vpon earth, dooth ſo behaue himſelfe, that he becommeth ſound and vpright, and imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth continually righteouſnes &amp; trueth. Which woordes are generall, and haue a verye large ſignification, inſomuch that they may contein euen the whole perfection of the Lawe.

                     <p>And therfore God, who loueth this inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie, making a couenaunt with his ſeruaunt <hi>Abraham,</hi> requireth of him, that he <hi>be perfite before him.</hi> And that the word <hi>righteouſnes</hi> is generall, it is well known to all, becauſe righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes containeth in it ſelfe all vertues, and the whole nature of vpright dealing and of the law of God. Which alſo may be ſaid of veritie and trueth. But yet in this place, theſe things ſeem rather to be refered to thoſe duties, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ought to exerciſe towards men, as appeereth by the whole ſequeale of that that followeth. <hi>Dauid</hi> therfore ſaith, that he, which aſpireth to the heauenly life, ought to frame and lead his life ſincerely, and to behaue himſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all fraud and guile towards others: and ſo to exerciſe iuſt dealing, that he hurt none, but profit all, rendring to euery man that which is his: to be no diſſembling or craftye perſon, but to ſpeak y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth in his hart, that is, his tongue to conſent with a pure and ſincere hart, and to do nothing ſubtelly or deceitfully. For in this wiſe muſt they behaue themſelues, that march
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:21193:211"/>toward that heauenly and bleſſed life.</p>
                     <p>Now in the verſes following, he paſſeth on to ſome more ſpeciall pointes, leaſt this, which he had ſaid in general, were not ſufficient and plaine inough-to teache vs, and to bring vs to the ſcope of his entended purpoſe. Therfore he addeth, that he ſhall dwel in the houſe of God, that hurteth not the good name or fame of his neighbour, nor that dooth, or ſuffreth to be doon any euill or reproche vnto him. For heere of things diuers and diſagréeing, things alſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agréeable are to be vnderſtood. As therfore in the verſe next before he declared, with what vertues he ſhould be adorned, that would dwel with God: ſo now he telleth vs, from what vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he muſt be free, and decked with vertues, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to theſe vices: as that he muſt not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not hurt any man with his tongue, but muſt carefully tender &amp; further euery mans credit: he muſt do euill to none, but good to all: ſlander no man, nor ayde him that dooth it, but rather reſiſt him.</p>
                     <p>The firſt thing therfore that is ſpoken off, is touching Detraction or ſlaunder, which is not lightly to be paſſed ouer, becauſe we do ſo eaſilye faile in this pointe. For the good name of a man, as ſaith <hi>Salomon,</hi> is a precious thing to euery one, and to be preferred before much
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:21193:211"/>treaſure, inſomuch that it is no leſſe gréeuous, to hurt a man with the tongue, then with a ſwoord: nay oftetimes the ſtroke of a tongue, is gréeuouſer then the wound of a ſpeare, as it is in the French prouerb. And therfore the tongue muſt be brideled, that we hurt not in any wiſe the good name of our neighbour: but preſerue it vnto him ſafe and ſound, as muche as in vs ſhall lye.</p>
                     <p>That which he addeth, touching <hi>euill</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurye,</hi> not to be doone to our neighbour, is like vnto that which we haue ſéen already, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> working or exerciſing of righteouſnes. He would haue vs therfore ſo to exerciſe all vp right dealing, that we might be farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any damage or wrong to our neighbours. And by the name of neighbour, is meant eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man and woman, as it is plaine and euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For we are all created of God, and placed in this world, that we might liue vprightly and ſincerely togither. And therfore he breaketh the law of humane ſocietie (For we are all ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and bound by this law of nature) that dooth hurt or iniurye to an other.</p>
                     <p>The third member of this verſe is, <hi>nor that reprocheth an other, or, that mainteineth not a falſe reporte giuen one againſt an other:</hi> which latter particle ſéemeth to be the better, ſith he
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:21193:212"/>had ſpoken before expreſſely, touching the good name of an other, not to be hurt or wronged with our tongue. To the which faulte this is next in degree, wher-with we are too too much encombred, and which we ſcarſe acknowledge to be a faulte, when we further and maintain the ſlaunders, deuiſed and giuen out by an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, againſt a man, either by hearing them, or by telling them forth to other, as we heard them. For why? it ſéemeth for the moſt parte to be enough for vs, if we can ſaye, that we feigne not this or that, nor make it of our owne heads, but onelye tell it foorth, as we heard it of others, without adding any thing of our owne braine.

                     <p>The two effects that followe, <hi>to contemne the wicked, and to honour the godlye,</hi> are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite the one to the other. But the former may ſéeme not to be ſufficiently beſeeming to a godlye man. For why ſhould he contemne or deſpiſe others, that is commaunded by all meanes to care for the credit of others, as we heard euen now? Nay a godly man, letting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers goe, ought to ſearch into himſelfe, and to accuſe himſelfe, but not to iudge of others. But this ſaying of the Prophet, is to be vnder ſtood, rather of the faultes then of the perſon. As euery man therfor is to be loued, ſo are the faultes of euery man to be hated of the godly. For ſo is God himſelfe, whome we deſire to be like vnto, that we might dwell with him, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected &amp; diſpoſed. For why? he hateth no man, naye he hateth nothing at all in this whole vniuerſall world, but only ſinne. For he is the author and preſeruer of all thinges, that be: and therfore doth good, and wiſheth well to al: onely of ſinne he is not the author, but the frée and vnconſtreigned will of man and Satan.
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:21193:213"/>Notwithſtanding God dooth ſo greatly hate ſinne, that by reaſon therof he dooth ſomtimes neglect and forſake men, yea and haue them in conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt.

This then is the meaning of the Prophet, that albeit in the Common weale by reaſon of the ſundry affaires and dealinges of men among themſelues, and the vſe of money ſo manifold, and neceſſary for the traffiks of men, and that almoſt in euery contract and bargaine: albeit, I ſay, for theſe and ſuch other like cauſes, it is plaine and euident, that all gaine, which is gotten by money, is not to be condemned: yet a godly man muſt take diligent heed, ſith there is alſo ſo great and many abuſes of money, leaſt he abuſe his moneye, to the hurt of his
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:21193:215"/>neighbour: as it is an vſuall practiſe amongſt rich men and ſome of the greater ſort, who by lending, or by giuing out their money to vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, are wont to ſnare and oppreſſe the poor and needier ſorte: as they commonly are wont to doo, who ſitting idle at home, make marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe only of their money, by giuing it out in this ſort to ſuch néedy perſons, altogither for gaines ſake, without hauing any regarde of his commoditie, to whome they giue it, but onelye of their owne gaine. For by this craft they eaſily get many into their ſnares, whom they doo not onlye bite, which is ment by the noune <gap reason="foreign">

Which rule, in humane affaires and contractes, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligentlye of vs euermore to be obſerued, if wee will liue vprightly as becommeth vs.</p>
                     <p>Now there is one only remaining, <hi>nor ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth reward,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>againſt the innocent:</hi> that is to ſay, he is not moued either for fauour, or flattery, or any other cauſe, to peruert iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: which I tabe not to be reſtreyned only vnto Magiſtrates and Iudges, ſeeing he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:21193:215"/>heere the life of a godlye man in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. For euen all priuate men alſo, doo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times either by requeſt ſpeak their minde, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching many controuerſies, riſen among their equals: or els not requeſted, doo giue ſentence of this or that controuerſie betweene others: and many a one oftetimes through meere en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, hatred, or fauour, do hurt this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and peruerte Iudgement. Chriſtian men therfor, whither they be Magiſtrates, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat perſons, ought neuer at any time to be wonne, either for hatred, or for fauour, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, to deface the trueth in iudgement, that ſo iudgement might be peruerted, but they muſt euermore giue all diligence, that the trueth may preuaile, and that iudgement be giuen for the innocent partie.</p>
                     <p>And therfore are the things, wherin <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith the godly doo exerciſe themſelues al their life long, and this one thing they ſet before their eyes, euen that they may ſerue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour their God, of whom they look for eternall life, in louing and helping their neighbours, as he commaundeth. Therefore theſe thinges beeing ſet downe, he concludeth the queſtion, which he in the beginning had propounded: <hi>He that dooth theſe things,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall neuer be moued,</hi> that is, He ſhall remaine for euer
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:21193:216"/>in the houſe of God, and neuer be caſt from thence, as <hi>Iſmael,</hi> that mocked <hi>Iſaac,</hi> was caſt out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe with his Mother, wherin yet <hi>Iſaac</hi> abode, and obtemed the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance. Thus therfore the godly, which will frame their liues after this rule, ſhal dwel and continue in the familie of God, and ſo obteyne the heauenly inheritance. For why almighty God loueth ſuch kinde of perſons, as deſire to he like vnto him, and acknowledgeth them for his owne, and bleſſeth them, rewarding them with eternall and euerlaſting life: the which if we ſuppoſe that there be any, as we profeſſe in the Creede, that <hi>we beleeue eternall life,</hi> if we earneſtly endeuer to come to it, then muſt we ſo behaue our ſelues héere, as we may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of it. Yea we muſt euen heer begin that heauenly life, and vpon this earth, euen now imitate and followe our Father, which is in heauen, and as Chriſt himſelfe admoniſheth, he perfit, euen as he is perfit, dooing good to all, as he dooth, which ſo mercifully graunteth the vſe of his ſunne, and raine to al, yea euen to his enemies. For, <hi>he that doth theſe things</hi> ſaith <hi>
                           <hi>Dauid,</hi> ſhal neuer be caſt out of the houſe of God,</hi> but ſhall dwell with him for euer.</p>
                     <p>Héer perhaps ſome man may maruel, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſhall ſée <hi>Dauid</hi> in ſo fewe woordes, thus to
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:21193:216"/>determine this Queſtion, touching the waye to eternall life, for the which there are at this day ſo many and great controuerſies among men. But, if he would heedefullye weigh and conſider, that the whole woorſhip and ſeruice of God, conſiſteth in the loue of God and of our neighbour, as it is preſcribed in the Lawe, he ſhould ceaſe to maruell. And therefore this queſtion might yet in fewer woords haue béen diſcuſſed: but for our ſake <hi>Dauid</hi> would ſtand the longer: wheras Chriſt, entreating of the ſelfeſame matter, requireth only the mariage garment. For when he came to viſit y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gueſtes that were bidden to the wedding, which were now buſie in taking their meat, he onlye ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r him out from the banquet, that <hi>wanted his wedding garment.</hi> And that is nothing els vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, then the ſincere knowledge of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hard and difficulte matters, as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlye thought to be, to the which Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, women, and poore people, that get their liuing by continuall labour, cannot attem vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, which yet, as Chriſt and <hi>Paul</hi> doo witneſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are more apt and neere to eternall life, then the learned for the moſt part, or mightye &amp; great men. For why? their pouertie and continuall trauaile of their body to get their liuing, and the ignoraunce of many thinges, which are
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:21193:217"/>taught in the Vniverſities and Schooles, is no let, but that they maye loue God and their neighbour ſincerelye, and liue without fraud or guile with others, in the fight of God.</p>
                     <p>But yet thou wilt ſaye, there are many things omitted heer of <hi>Dauid,</hi> For there is no mention heere of Faith, which onlye malieth vs righteous, and acceptable before God, there is no mention of the Sacrifices, nor of the moſt ſacred Ceremomes, which in the time of <hi>Dauid</hi> were commaunded, and in vſe nay there ſéemeth to be no mention made heer of the firſt Table, wherin the woorſhip of God is conteined: and not ſo much as all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the ſecond Table of the Lawe haue heere beene ſet downe. For, neither of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reuerence towardes Parentes, and Magiſtrates, nor of adultrie, and ſome other things, haue any thing been expreſſely touched<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And therefore it may ſame that <hi>Dauids</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is maymed and vnperfect, and that this Pſalme is not ſufficient to determine the ſaid Queſtion, touching the controueiſie of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and way to eternall life. Theſe thinges then, afore wee make an end, are breefelye at leaſt to be declared, leaſt any man ſhould think that <hi>Dauid</hi> hath not perfourmed his promiſe, and therefore not meete or conuenient to reſt
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:21193:217"/>vpon his woordes. Firſt therfore it is not to be thought, that ſo rare a Prophet of God, was to fond and fooliſh, as not to ſee, what queſtion he had put foorth to be handled: or, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of the things, which euen now were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected. What then? could he not, or would he not explane this matter vnto vs? Neither of both can be ſaide of him: but rather in very déede he hath wonderfully and diuinely reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the Queſtion propounded. And therfore, that thoſe thinges maye be vnderſtood, which were obiected, this is to be holden for trueth, that <hi>Dauid</hi> in this place, deſcribeth the life of a Chriſtian, and of one that loueth and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth God: of a Chriſtian, I ſay, that is not in his owne opinion, or by the iudgment of other men accounted ſuch a one, but that is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the ſight of God. For therefore it was, that <hi>Dauid</hi> in the beginning of the Pſalm, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected his ſpeech to God himſelf, that he might declare and ſhewe, that he ſpeaketh of ſuch as feare God in trueth, and not of hiporrites. If this be determined and concluded vpon, the things that were obiected, ſhall eaſily be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. And, that we may touche that firſte, which we ſaid, that there are héer ſome things left out of the ſecond Table of the Lawe, it is not abſolutely true. For thoſe thinges are in
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:21193:218"/>the beginning generally ſet downe, in which the points, that are not ſpeciallye named, are eaſily conteyned. For why? to ſuch a one, as is ſound and perfit, and that ſincerelye imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth righteouſnes and trueth, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wanting to the obſeruation of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table of the Law: no, nor yet of the firſt if ſo be we will referre theſe thinges alſo vnto that, as in many places we muſt doo. But why, wilt thou ſay, was not euery thing ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially and by name reckoned vp of him? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, ſay I, it was neither néedfull, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient. (For ſo there would neuer haue been any end) but thoſe thinges are touched, which being ſet downe, if thou be earneſtlye affected with the feare of God, and loueſt him ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, thou canſt not be deceiued in the reſt. For the ſpirit of God, which ſhalbe giuen thee, will ſo eaſily and ſafelye direct thee, that thou ſhalt not goe aſtraye from the right path, that is, from the glory of God, and loue of thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. And therfore to a man thus affected and diſpoſed, there was no need, that euery thing ſhould be preſcribed, becauſe that diuine vncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on dooth teach and enſtruct him in all things.</p>
                     <p>But for all this thou wilt ſay, that the firſt Table oughte in no wiſe to be pretermitted, wherein faith and the worſhip of God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:21193:218"/>ſeing the other without this cannot be obſerued. For the obſeruation which ſéemeth to be of this, without that, is meere hipocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. For if there were any, which honored and reuerenced his Parentes and Magiſtrates, and committed neither man-ſlaughter, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultrie, nor theft, and that neither beare falſe witnes, nor coueted his neighbours wife, nor any thing that were his: yet excepte he loued God chéefely and aboue all things, he could not be accounted a true worſhipper of God. How then is this foundation omitted? No verily it is not omitted, as we ſaid before. For <hi>Dauid</hi> héere deſcribeth the life &amp; manners of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that feareth &amp; loueth God. He declareth therfore how ſuch a one ought and is wont to behaue himſelfe with others, whileſt he liueth heere. That then is not pretermitted, but is ſet downe firſt as the foundation: and in that very pointe, dooth faith conſiſt, or rather that thing it ſelfe is the true and liuely faith, which ſtandeth not in a naked and bare knowledge of God (for then were it dead) but the life and efficacy therof, is that ſame loue of God aboue al things, &amp; of our neighbour as of our ſelues: For except Faith haue this in it, it is dead.</p>
                     <p>And this is that wonderfull Loue and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, wherof <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh. <hi>1 Corinth. 13.</hi> or,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:21193:219"/>if ye will, that religious pietie towards God and men, which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mother of all good actions, and by the which Faith worketh, which other wiſe is dead, as ſaith <hi>Iames.</hi> But why was not this expreſſely mencioned? becauſe it was not néedfull. For why? all the <hi>Iewes</hi> profeſſed, as we do at this day, that they knew &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped one God: but the moſt of them denyed it in their deedes, as it commonly commeth to paſſe. For it is an eaſie matter for a man, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by word of mouth, or by outward cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, to profeſſe him-ſelfe a worſhipper of God: but to be in déede that which thou profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſ, that is to ſaye, to deny thy ſelfe, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce this world, that thou mighteſt ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerue God &amp; thy neighbours, is a thing more difficult and rare. Forſomuch therfore as all men and, as in times paſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ſo at this day euery where the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, are wont with full mouth to make their vaſit, that they are the true worſhippers of God, there was a rule to be ſet downe, by the which all might be tryed, leaſte any man ſhould deceiue himſelfe, and that the good might be knowne of the good and ſo linked togither with a ſtreighter bond. Now this could not be fetched from the former Table of the Law, which altogither conſiſteth therely in the hart and minde, and requireth
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:21193:219"/>faith in God and moſt high neuerence. But in this caſe all will ſay, that they are ſo affected, and albeit they cannot deceiue God, yet they ofitimes deceiue both themſelues and others. That rule then ſtandeth in the ſecond Table of Gods Law, wherin a man cannot ſo eaſilye feigne or counterfet. Thou ſaiſt, that God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie is thy God, as the firſt Cummaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the firſt Table dooth require, and thou truſteſt in him: but I, for my parte, do doubt of that matter, and cannot tell, whither thou plaieſt the hypocrize, or no. And therfore ſhew mee, as ſaithe <hi>Iames, <hi>that faith of thine by thy woorkes,</hi>
                        </hi> which are commaunded in the other Table of the Lawe: prooue that thou dooſt in this wiſe ſo greatly loue God, that thou canſt willingly ſuffer and do all things for his ſake, that thou reuenge not iniuries doon vnto thee, but wiſh well from thine hart, to all, yea euen to thine enemies (for ſo did Chriſte) becauſe, whileſt they vexe and trouble thée, they wotte not what they do. If thou behaue thy ſelfe thus, I will beléeue that y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> art the man, whom thou makeſt thy ſelfe to be: but if not, how ſhall I beléeue it to be true, ſith all men will not ſtick to ſay aſmuch, but yet deny it in their déedes: Therfore by this rule our life is to be examined, leaſt we deceiue either our ſelues,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:21193:220"/>or others. <hi>Dauid</hi> then made no mencion of the firſt Table, becauſe al ſay they beleeue in God, and worſhip him: but he touched that, wherby it might appeere, how truely they make that profeſſion. For if it were poſſible to finde fire that were colde, or yee that were hotte, then might alſo a man be, as many in theſe daies auouch them ſelues to be, a true worſhiper of God, and yet not loue his neighbour as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, wherin alſo notwithſtanding conſiſteth the worſhip and ſeruice of God. But that ſhal neuer be ſéene, for it is againſt nature. Foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much therfore as men commonly vaunte of a vaine ſhadow of Faith, &amp; deceiue themſelues, whileſt they brag, that they both know God, and beléeue in him, not conſidering aduizedly, what it is to beléeue in him, nor wherin it con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſiſteth: therfore both <hi>Dauid</hi> in this place, as alſo Chriſt &amp; <hi>Paule</hi> euery where, do vrge and require, that this ſhould be ſhewed in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of the ſecond Table, that is to ſay, in the ſincere loue of our neighbour, wherin for no other cauſe is the whole accompliſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lawe ſaid to conſiſt. For, except thou be affected with that ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t loue of God, which may drawe thee to his obedience, thy Faith is colde, nay dead, as béeing deſtitute of her naturall heate. Yea I dare be holde to
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:21193:220"/>ſay, that this is not faith, but a vain perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on touching God, or touching his ſon Chriſt, wher-by thou deceiueſt thy ſelfe. This true and liuely faith therfore, which dwelleth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in the ſoule, and ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be ſéene of man, but of God onlye, who is the ſearcher of the heart, is heere deſcribed by the effectes, as it is alſo in many other places. He that is endued with this Faith, ſhall doo, ſaith <hi>Dauid,</hi> the things that are héere preſcribed, and ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be caſt out of the houſe of God, becauſe he belongeth vnto him: for he is endued with his Spirit. Like as therfore when the earth is ſet directly &amp; diameter-wiſe, as they ſay, betwéen the Sunne and the Moon, no man liuing ſéeth it with his eyes, neither can ſee it, but God diſcearneth it apparantlye: yet we by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect therof doo eaſilye and moſt certainlye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it, by the Eclips of the Moone: for ſhe is therefore darkened, becauſe that by reaſon of the Earth put between her and the Sunne, ſhe cannot then borrow her light of the Sunne: ſo neither can any man, except God, ſee the faith of another body, but by the effectes. And as by ſmoke comming forth of a chimney, we gather that there is fire: and, as we certainelye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and knowe, that a man is endued with life and ſoule, whom we ſee to walke, to ſpeak,
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:21193:221"/>and to doo thoſe thinges y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> belong vnto a man, albeit we ſee not his ſoule neither indeede can we ſee it (for it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth not within compaſſe of our ſight) euen ſo we Faith by her effects. And on the other ſide, as if a man would perſwade vs, that there were fire, wher there is no heat, or that there were life in that carkaſſe, that in no wiſe moued, felte, or breathed, we would ſtedfaſtly deny it, and that trulye: ſo, he that ſaith he hath faith without this diuine heate, that is to ſay, ſeruent loue of God, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this vitall ſpirit of faith, is deceiued, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is any credit to be giuen vnto him: for this cauſe therfore it is, that the Holye ghoſt euery where in the holy Scriptures, bringeth men to this point, as <hi>Dauid</hi> dooth in this place that they ſhould not deceiue themſelues and others: for indéed there cannot be a more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine teſtimony of faith, which is not ſéene with the eye, and whereof all men doo boaſte, then by the effects therof, and good woorkes of all which ſhe is the Mother: and therefore to her, as the cauſe, is worthilye attributed the dignitie and glory of righteouſnes, but yet ſo as it be ſuch as we haue ſaide, to wit liuelye, and woorking through loue. For otherwiſe neither it, nor any thing that commeth from it, ſhall any waye obteine righteouſnes: but
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:21193:221"/>ſhall onlye be méere hipocriſie, or els a vaine knowledge in the minde of ſome God. And therefore they are deceiued, that think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be Chriſtians, in what Church or congregation ſoeuer they be, except they walke in the waye, that is heere preſcribed of <hi>Dauid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But what ſhall we ſaye of the Sacrifices, and Ceremonies, that in the time of <hi>Dauid</hi> were in their full force and ſtrength, why doth <hi>Dauid</hi> make no mention of them? becauſe the godly man knew well inough, that the woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God conſiſted not in them, neither Faith, but the outward exerciſe of faith and Gods worſhip: therfore <hi>Pſal. 15.</hi> he ſaith, <hi>That theſe outward Sacrifices and burnt offrings doo not pleaſe God,</hi> to wit of themſelues, <hi>but the Sacrifice acceptable to God, is a troubled ſpirit, and a broken or contrite hart.</hi> Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thou wilt ſay, he that taketh vpon him to deſcribe the waye of ſaluation vnto others, ought not to omit the Ceremonies ordeyned of God, wherin faith and religion doo exerciſe themſelues. But religiouſnes &amp; faith is much better and more holilye exerciſed, in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall duties or actions of the ſecond Table, that is, in helping and releeuing of our neighbours, then in any ceremonies, as witneſſeth Chriſt
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:21193:222"/>
                        <hi>Math. 25.</hi> And this ſhall appéere moſt plainely in the latter day. For men occupied in Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies doo commonly mock God, and woorke diſceit, counterfetting themſelues to be other then they be. Which if it were not ſo, they did very ill, that ſet forth vnto vs, the articles of our faith, where there is no mention made of Baptiſme, no mention of the Lords Supper, nor of the exerciſing of any other Ceremony. But thoſe holye men, whither they were the Apoſtles, or other that next ſucceeded them, knew right well, that thoſe things, were vſed aſwell of the bad, as of the good, and therefore that the true and ſpirituall woorſhip of God ſtandeth not in them, whereby the good might be diſcerned from the euill: but in this rather, that thou by a true and liuely faith, apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the infinite mercy of God, offred vnto thée in Chriſt, maiſt ſo immitate and follow him, that thou maiſt become a newe man, and ſo ſeruently loue God, that for his ſake, thou maiſt bring thy ſelf to nothing, to the end thou maiſt ſerue him and thy neighbour, as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth. For in this pointe ſtandeth, ſhall ſtand, and alwaies hath ſtood, true and ſincere religion: which afterward notwithſtanding in diuers and ſundrye cerimontes brought in for our weaknes, is exerciſed and put in vre.</p>
                     <pb n="435" facs="tcp:21193:222"/>
                     <p>But if theſe things be thus, it is ſo far off, that this ſentence touching the waye to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, ſhould be maymed and vnperfit, that contrari-wiſe it is to be thought moſt perfit and abſolute, which in ſo few woordes ſetteth downe thoſe things, that being ſet down, and ſimplye (as euerye man may) vnderſtand, all thinges muſt of neceſſitie be well and as they ſhould be, inſomuch that there is none, that dooth theſe thinges, but he ſhall alſo be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the bleſſed life to come, or els <hi>Dauid</hi> is a falſe Prophet, which no man in his right minde will ſaye. And if this be ſo indéede, why doo men ſtriue ſo much about this matter and one ſo cruelly rage againſt another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> verily becauſe ſuch is the curioſitie of mans braine, and deſire of knowledge, that omitting that, which was eſpecially to be regarded, they all, for the moſt part, intangle themſelues in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and moſt difficult queſtions, and will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force others to be of like minde with them in euery thing: and ſuch alſo is the blockiſhnes of many, that being giuen to a number of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, they will driue and compell others to vſe and frequent the ſame. And in the mean ſeaſon that Wedding garment is neglected, which notwithſtanding, if ſo be we will feaſte with God, and his Angels, and with al the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:21193:223"/>Saintes in heauen, is eſpeciallye requiſite. And therfore all men haue héere, wherin they may ſafely reſt, if they will, and willing they ought to be, if they thinke meete to ſtand to <hi>Dauids</hi> teſtimony: they haue, wherby hatreds contencions, perſecutions, fire and ſword, both betwéene Kings and armed Souldiers, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong learned men, may eaſilye be quenched. But if neither Kinges, by the authoritie of King <hi>Dauid,</hi> nor Learned men, by th'autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> can be kept within compaſſe of their duties: yet haue all the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this Pſalm, where, in this ſo great a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde of religion, they may repoſe themſelues, that ſo they may neuer, whatſoeuer encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance they ſuffer of any, be diſcouraged in their mindes, but conſtantlye proceed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuer in the way preſcribed them héere, which is the Kingly and Propheticall way, certaine and aſſured to that moſt happy and heauenly life.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Iames</hi> in the firſt of the ſower verſes, which we haue read, propoundeth a queſtion, the which immediatly repeating, he ſetteth forth by the adiuncts: and beeing thus propounded and ſet forth, he in the thrée other verſes, by an argument drawne from a Sinulitude, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth and determineth it. The Queſtion is this, <hi>What auaileth it, brethren,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>If a man ſaith he hath faith, and haue no woorkes?</hi> that is to ſay, Though a man ſaith that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeueth in God the Father almighty, or alſo in
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:21193:224"/>Ieſus Chriſt his Sonne, and dooth exerciſe this religion in rites and ceremonies, and yet hath no woorkes preſcribed in the Lawe, that is, neither loueth God aboue all thinges, nor other men as himſelfe: <hi>what good,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall ſuch a faith doo,</hi> wherwith he that is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, ſhall neither loue God as becommeth him, nor yet men? But, for ſomuch as there are many profitable vſes of Faith, wherof al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo we receiue ſome in this life: th'apoſtle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peateth and enlargeth the Queſtion. <hi>Can ſuch a faith,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſaue a man?</hi> to the intent it might appeere, that he demaundeth not the queſtion heer, touching euery vtilitie of faith: but of this expreſſely, <hi>Whither ſuch a faith can ſaue a man.</hi> And heere is propounded and ſet forth the principall and moſt excellent fruite of Faith, to witte, the ſaluation of our ſoules: which except Faith doo miniſter vnto vs, it is vnprofitable. For the other vſes thereof, if this be taken awaye, ſhall be of no accompt: and therfore all, that woorſhip God, doo woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him in manner with this hope, that they may obtaine of him a bleſſed and euerlaſting life. For, albeit the trueſt and righteſt way of woorſhipping him is, that we maye loue and woorſhip him, for his owne ſake, becauſe he is beſt, and not for any benefit or commoditie of
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:21193:225"/>our owne: accordingly as we loue the things that are faire, becauſe they are faire, although we reape no fruit at all by them: yet God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying himſelfe to our capacitie, dooth euerye where in the holye Scriptures, and in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine promiſes and threatninges, make menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of life and death euerlaſting, to the end be might allure vs vnto him, and fraye vs from ſinne and iniquitie.</p>
                     <p>Inaſmuch therfore as all men, which ſerue and woorſhip God, doo from him looke for the moſt bleſſed life eternall, that is, ſuch a life, as wherin, all euils being vtterly abandoned, there is ſtore and plenty of all good things: and the only entrie thereunto, and way that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to it, is the way of righteouſnes, which is perfectly compriſed and declared in the Law of God: and this righteouſnes no man can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain vnto by his own ſtrength (for by nature we are all ſinners) it remaineth, that faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone doth giue &amp; beſtowe the ſame vpon man, or els, that all men ſhould vtterly and vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally periſh. Wherupon alſo it plainlye appée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that it is only faith, that deliuereth wret<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched men from all euill, and bringeth them to the fruition of that high and ſoueraigne good, ſo greatly wiſhed for of all. For why? faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone giueth vnto man perfit righteouſnes, and
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:21193:225"/>therefore alſo eternall life. If ſo be then faith miniſter not this profit vnto vs, it is veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnprofitable, ſith men, as I ſaide, beléeue in God, to the end they might be ſaued by him. And therfore, if their faith cannot perfourme thus much vnto them, they beleeue in vaine. Th'apoſtle therfore by repeating the queſtion propounded, dooth profitably and to very good purpoſe demaund, whither that faith, that is without woorkes, be of ſuch force, as that it may ſaue men. For if this be true, we ought to be contented with it: but if it be not, either we muſt ſeeke another way to life, or elſe we muſt periſh. And therfore how profitable, yea how neceſſarye the true explication of this queſtion is to be knowne, to all that are deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of eternall life, there is no man, that ſéeth not.</p>
                     <p>Now this dooth <hi>Iames</hi> himſelfe declare vnto vs in the three ſhort verſes following. Yea the very interrogations, wherby he propoundeth the queſtion, ſéeme to conteine a ſecret anſwer vnto it: and, to tell vs, what we ought to iudge of this queſtion. For this the common courſe of queſtioning dooth proue. For why? if I ſhould ſaye to ſome lewde and deſperate knaue, profeſſing Chriſtian Religion with vs, in the vſe of the Sacraments, publike pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:21193:226"/>and ſermons, in this manner, thinkeſt thou that this outward profeſſion of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion will doo thée any good, when as thou haſt a filthy and vncleane hart? art thou of an opinion that it will ſaue thée: it is euen as much, as if I denied it, and ſaid, Doubtleſſe thou art not to looke, that this outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of thy mouth ſhall make thée become acceptable to God. So whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, <hi>What profiteth it a man to ſay he hath faith, when he hath no workes,</hi> that is, liueth not by Faith: <hi>can this Faith ſaue him that ſo beleeueth?</hi> it is all one, as if he flatly denyed it. And if we take it thus, then by the teſtimonye and authoritie of <hi>Iames</hi> himſelf, the queſtion ſhal in this wiſe be determined, and we are to holde, that by faith, without woorks, no man can attain vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſaluation. And we muſt vndoubtedly ſtand to the iudgemente of <hi>Iames,</hi> as to that which procéedeth, not from man, but from God. For albeit he was a man, yet becauſe he was the Apoſtle of Chriſt, and enſpired with the Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghoſt, that ſpake this, which alſo is agreeable with the reſt of the diuine Oracles, who, but an vncleane perſon, will call this matter into queſtion? Notwithſtanding, leaſt he might ſéeme willing, to conuince and enforce vs, by his ſole authoritie, to beléeue it, he addeth a
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:21193:226"/>reaſon by way of compariſon, whereby he ſo plainely and manifeſtlye proueth the thing to be ſo: that now he leadeth vs, not only by his authoritie, but alſo by force of reaſon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they willingly ſubmit themſelues that are partakers of reaſon, as it were by the hand to the vnderſtanding of the queſtion propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: And his reaſon is this: <hi>If ſome poore wretched man were heere preſent, deſtitute of all thinges neceſſarye, naked and hungrye, to whome ſome riche and wealthye perſon would ſay with all gentlenes: Goe thy waye hence, I pray thee, and take meate, and warme thy ſelfe: and yet giueth him nothing for to eate, or wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to warme himſelfe: though to outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance this ſpeech of the rich man ſeem to be honeſt and kinde to the poore, yet what good doth it to the poor creature that is like to ſterue for hunger and colde?</hi> Nay doubtleſſe it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iniurious and reprochefull againſt him. Thou ſeeſt a man deſtitute of all thinges, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and hunger ſtarued, and thou ſaiſte vnto him, <hi>Goe home, take thy meate, and warme thy ſelfe:</hi> and yet thou knoweſt him to want all thinges neceſſary, as neither hauing houſe, to goe to, nor meat, to eate, nor clothing, to put on, nor any thing to warme himſelfe withall. Dooſt thou not mock and deride his pouertie?
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:21193:227"/>dooſt thou not alike, as if thou vpbraideſt him with his poore eſtate and miſerie? <hi>Euen after the ſame manner,</hi> ſaith <hi>Iames, <hi>ſtandes the caſe, when a man profeſſeth himſelfe, to beleeue in God the Father almightye, and in Ieſus Chriſt his Sonne.</hi>
                        </hi> For the ſpeeche is honeſt and good, and in ſhewe godlye. But, vnleſſe ſuch a man loue God with all his hart, and ſerue him as his Father, and for his ſake, men alſo, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after his owne image and ſimilitude, ſo as he may labour to profit all, and tohurt none: this mans externall and outward confeſſion of mouth, ſhal neither be accepted nor accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted off of God: but rather be iniurious &amp; contu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>melious againſt him. He may cry as loud and as long as he will, O God the father almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye, I beléeue in thee: and O Chriſt Ieſu, the Sonne of the liuing God, I beléene in thee: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as yet he neither loueth God in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, nor men for Gods cauſe: this beléefe; as I may ſo call it, ſhall profit him nothing at al, ſaith <hi>Iames. <hi>For this faith, that wanteth works, is dead,</hi>
                        </hi> ſaith he. For heereupon hangeth the force of <hi>Iames</hi> his argument,
<q>
                           <l>That which is dead, cannot giue life,</l>
                           <l>But faith without workes, is dead:</l>
                        </q>
Therfore, <hi>It cannot giue life, neither is it accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, but rather reprochefull vnto him:</hi>
                        <pb n="445" facs="tcp:21193:227"/>becauſe it maketh a ſhew as though it gaue honour vnto God, and yet giueth none, but will haue him to be contented with the ſmoke of vaine talke and profeſſion, when as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth the hart of man, and not woordes.</p>
                     <p>This is, if I be not deceiued, the true and proper expoſition of this place: whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peereth (as by many other alſo) that there is a double or two folde faith of men: the one, which wanteth and is without good woorkes: the other, which floweth and aboundeth with them. The former is ſaid of <hi>Iames</hi> to be dead, becauſe it is barren and vnprofitable, but this, for that it is effectuall and painefull, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called quick or liuelye. The one conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth either in a certaine knowledge of God and in the only ſkill and contemplation of his diuine miſteries: or els in ſome certaine credulous and ignorant opinion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man ſuppoſeth himſelfe to beléeue that which he vnderſtandeth not: and the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting it ſelfe (as ye would ſay) contented in a ſimple and ſound knowledge of God in Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is wholy conuerſant in action, and occupied in well dooing. The difference, which is betwéen both, all or the greateſt number are for the moſt parte ignorant of, neither doo they paſſe much whither they knew it or no, becauſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:21193:228"/>they couet to liue to themſelues, rather then vnto God. And yet this difference not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knowne nor regarded, it commeth to paſſe that very many, in ſtead of the chéefe and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne good, which they deſire, doo fall into extreme miſerie, and all becauſe they thinke themſelues to be endued with ſuch a faith, as wherby they may be ſaued, and ſo flatter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in it, liuing in pleaſure &amp; delight, where in very deed it is only a vaine ſhadowe of true faith, and nothing els: in regarde whereof we are erneſtly to endeuer at this time, that both we maye vnderſtand this diuerſitie, and alſo imbrace the true and liuelye faith, if ſo be we deſire to be ſaued. But thou wilte ſaye, who would thinke that euer there were any, or there were ſome ſuch in times paſt, yet that there ſhould be any at this daye ſo fooliſhe and brutiſh, to beleeue, that he ſhalbe ſaued by ſuch a faith. Yes verily, ſay I, there both were ſome, when the Apoſtle wrote theſe thinges (for otherwiſe why ſhould he purpoſelye haue handled this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t throughout this whole Chapter, yea throughout the whole Epiſtle, wherin he ſo greatly vrgeth workes?) and alſo that there are many in our time, and perhaps alſo among vs not a few, the ſaying of Chriſt being as yet conuerſant on earth, and ſpeking
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:21193:228"/>of his laſt comming to iudgement, may ſéeme to be a proof: <hi>When the Son of man ſhall come ſuppoſe ye that he ſhal finde faith on the earth?</hi> Wherby he declareth, that in the latter daies faith wilbe very rare, and hard to finde: but, if all that ſay, they beleeue in God, or in Chriſt and profeſſe it outwardlye in Religion, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued trulye and in déede, then were there no ſmall number of beleeuers, but a very great companye. It appéereth then that to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſſion of Faith ſomething is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that it may be true and iuſtifying. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that this may the more cléerelye appeere, we will endeuer to declare it more at large.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Turkes</hi> doo ſay, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue in almighty God, maker of heauen and earth, gouernour and perſeuer of all thinges: Yea all Nations in a manner doo beleeue and confeſſe as much. For a man ſhall finde fewe, that beleeue not in one God, through thoſe impreſſions of knowledge, which God hath engrauen in mens mindes. And this faith is true, as touching the ſenſe and meanig of the woordes. For God is in very déede almighty, maker and preſeruer of all thinges. There faith then is in this reſpect, not falſe: no nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is their faith feigned or counterfet, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:21193:229"/>they beléeue euen ſo, as they ſpeak, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doo their minde diſagree from their talke.</p>
                     <p>Therefore their faith is not feigned, as though they ſpake one thing, and beléeued an other: or as though their tung and hart agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not togither. Naye their confeſſion which they make of God, is our confeſſion. For we confeſſe in the Apoſtles créed, that <hi>We beleeue in God the Father almightye, maker of heauen and earth.</hi> How falleth it out then, that if our Faith be true, theirs ſhould be falſe and feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? Shal not then this faith of theirs in God the Father ſaue them? <hi>No,</hi> ſaith <hi>Iames: <hi>For euen the Deuils alſo beleeue,</hi>
                        </hi> and acknowledge that there is one God almightye, maker of heauen and earth: and yet for al that they are not iuſtified, neither are they apt to eternall life. No more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo can our faith in God the Father ſaue vs.</p>
                     <p>But thou wilt ſay, we are to think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe touching faith in the Sonne of God, in whome they beléeue not. For, <hi>he that confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Chriſt, ſhalbe ſaued,</hi> But all Chriſtians, in what place, or of what ſort ſoeuer they be, whither they be <hi>Romaniſtes,</hi> or other (for I dare not deny the name of Chriſtians to the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtes,</hi> ſith the learneder writers doo confeſſe the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be the Church of God,
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:21193:229"/>but yet a ſtraying Church) all, I ſay, do with one mouth confeſſe, that they beléeue in Chriſt the Sonne of God, who for the ſinnes of men hauing taken our nature vpon him, ſuffered, died, and roſe againe from the dead, aſcended into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heauens, from whence alſo he ſhal come in the latter daye to iudge both the quick and dead. And this faith touching Chriſt is true: neither is it feigned in them: For they doo euen ſo think of Chriſt, as they ſay they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue. Shall this faith therefore ſaue all that doo thus beleeue, if it want woorkes? <hi>No, it ſhall not,</hi> ſaith <hi>Iames.</hi> Beléeueſt thou that Chriſt took mans nature vpon him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in both wrought and ſuffred what ſoeuer was neceſſarye for mens ſaluation thou dooſt well, neither beleeueſt thou amiſſe: but the <hi>Deuils know all theſe things, and they do no leſſe ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly beleeue them,</hi> then thou.</p>
                     <p>What is then required more? Not, that thou ſhouldeſt knowe or beleeue any more of Chriſt, as the things, which he ſaid or did, and yet were not committed to writing, the which as <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, were almoſt innumerable. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall this ſtand or goe for payment: For why? if thou haddeſt euen al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole Bible by hart in Hebrue, Gréek, and Latin, &amp; in thy mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther tung: Nay, which is much more and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:21193:230"/>if thou couldeſt tell the true ſenſe and meaning of all thinges that are written, and beléeuedſt them to be moſt true: yet ſhalt thou not thereby be ſaued. For the Deuils vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand &amp; know the things that are written, and which haue béene doone from the beginning of the worlde for the ſaluation of men, and they beleeue them all to be true: yea and they are in the knowledge and ſkill of thoſe things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedlye aboue vs: and yet ſhall they not for al that be ſaued, as <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith héer. What is then further required? This perhaps, will ſome man ſay, that we beleeue that Chriſt did not onlye ſuffer, but that euerye one beléeue that he ſuffred alſo for him. But, what if we falſely perſwade our ſelues of this, as we are wont to deuiſe &amp; imagine many things of our ſelues: what if, I ſay, ſome lewd &amp; wicked man an idolater, or manſlear would perſwade him ſelf, that Chriſt died for him, as it is like that many in <hi>Europe</hi> doo perſwade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues? Wil Chriſt, for this vaine perſwaſions ſake ſaue him? <hi>Many,</hi> ſaith Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>in that daye ſhall cry out after this manner, Lord Lord, open vnto vs: we haue propheſied, and caſt out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils in thy name: but they ſhall receiue this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer from him, Departe from me all ye woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of iniquitie, for I know ye not.</hi> Theſe men
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:21193:230"/>perſwaded them-ſelues that Chriſt died for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and they looked to haue had life from him, but this did them no good. What is it then at the laſt, which is required? <hi>works,</hi> ſaith <hi>Iames, <hi>which if faith haue not, it is dead:</hi>
                        </hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot giue either righteouſnes, or life eternall.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding, it ſéemeth that this faith in God, and in Chriſt his Sonne, compriſed in the Apoſtles Créede, is moſt perfit &amp; abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and that nothing els can further be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. So, ſay I, likewiſe doth a painted man ſeeme to conſiſt of all his parts and members, and yet is he nothing els, but a painted man, or the picture and ſhadowe of a man: which alſo in effect) is to be ſaid of this faith of thine. Or, that we may tarry in the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of <hi>Iames,</hi> the carkaſſe of a man hath all the partes and members of a mans body: and yet for all that it is not a man, becauſe it lacketh a ſpirit ſaith he in the laſt verſe of this Chapter. So that ſame faith, ſaith he, <hi>without woorkes, is dead,</hi> though he vnderſtood and beléeued the foreſaid Créede of Th'apoſtles, yea and the whole Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble beſides.</p>
                     <p>But thou wilt ſay, theſe thinges ſéeme to be cleane contrarye to the doctrine receiued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, and to the writinges of <hi>Paule,</hi> No
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:21193:231"/>verily. For why? they that iudge rightlye of iuſtification by faith, doo not diſagree from <hi>Iames,</hi> neither is <hi>Paule</hi> contrary to <hi>Iames.</hi> Yet <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, that we are iuſtified by faith only, without the woorkes of the Law. <hi>Paule</hi> indeed hath not the woord, Onlye: but yet when he ſaith, that <hi>we are iuſtified without the workes of the Law,</hi> I haue no doubt of it, but that it followeth by the true expoſition of <hi>Paule,</hi> that a man is iuſtified by faith onlye. But I ſay, that it came neuer into <hi>Pauls</hi> mind, to affirm, that faith, which is without works, doth iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie: (for ſo he ſhould indeed haue been contrary to <hi>Iames</hi>) but he attributeth the power and praiſe of iuſtification, to a true and liuely faith which is neuer voide of good woorkes, and not to the woorks themſelues: which is ſpoken by him not onely wittily, as euery thing els, but alſo truly and Chriſtianly.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Abraham</hi> thou wilt ſaye, by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Paule,</hi> in that only that he beleeued God, promiſing him a plentifull po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie, was accounted righteous. <hi>Abraham <hi>beleeued God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſnes.</hi>
                        </hi> But, <hi>wilt thou knowe, Ovaine man,</hi> ſaith <hi>Iames</hi> heere, <hi>that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not iuſtified by faith, without woorkes? Did he not offer vp his ſonne <hi>Iſaac</hi> on the altar? <hi>Abrahams</hi>
                        </hi>
                        <pb n="453" facs="tcp:21193:231"/>faith then was not that fruitleſſe and barren faith, which conſiſteth in the knowledge or in the ignorant beleefe of ſome certaine points of Diuinitie: but that effectuall and woorking faith, which frameth a man to the obedience of God: for this appeereth plain by the life and déeds of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But yet, ſome obiect, that the ſame cannot be ſaide of the Theefe, that was crucified with Chriſt. For when he had ſpent his whole life in euill dooing, and had ſaid vnto Chriſt being now at the point of death, <hi>Remember me whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou commeſt into thy kingdome:</hi> he heard forthwith, <hi>This daye ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe:</hi> and immediatly after he died. Yea but, ſay I, the faith of this Theefe was very liuely and effectuall. For the effectes of a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith are theſe, an erneſt feare of God, which <hi>Salomon</hi> the wiſeſt of all other affirmeth, <hi>to be the beginning of wiſdome:</hi> ſecondlye the <hi>inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Gods name, For whoſoeuer calleth vpon the name of the Lord, ſhalbe ſaued:</hi> the acknowledgment and confeſſion of ſinnes: loue and dutifulnes toward our neighbour. And all theſe things, in that little ſpace of time, did the liuely faith of that Theefe vtter and bring forth. For that he was affected with an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt feare of God, it appéereth by this, in that
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:21193:232"/>reprouing the other Theefe, which reuiled Chriſt, he ſaid, <hi>Feareſt thou not God, that ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt vpon this man? We are indeede heere for our miſdeedes, and are worthily puniſhed: but this man hath doone nothing amiſſe.</hi> He called earneſtly vpon God, <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>remember me, when thou commeſt into thy kingdom.</hi> He acknowledged and confeſſed his ſinnes, <hi>we are iuſtly puniſhed,</hi> ſaith he, to his fellow: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by alſo it appereth, that he ſuffered paciently, ſo cruell and ſhamefull a death: He diſcharged his duty alſo toward his neighbour: when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous to doo him good, he admoniſhed him, <hi>that he ſhould not raile vpon Chriſt,</hi> but conſider earneſtly of his own ſinnes. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his faith was not dead, but liuing and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall. It is no meruaile the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though through it, he obteyned life: which by a dead faith, no man euer obteyned, neyther ſhall at any time obteine.</p>
                     <p>But, ſeeing this dead faith knoweth and acknowledgeth God to be almighty, maker of Heauen and earth, and Chriſt alſo his Sonne to be ſent of God for our redemption: what is required more, or what is wanting vnto it? Euen the Life or Soule, as <hi>Iames</hi> declareth in the laſt verſe of this Chap. Whereby it might be quickened to well dooing. For as a dead
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:21193:232"/>carkaſſe conſiſteth of all and ſingular his parts and members, and yet for all that neither mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth nor liueth, becauſe it wanteth a Soule or Spirit, which might giue it power to moue and liue: euen ſo faith, though it vnderſtand, whatſoeuer is neceſſary to be knowne of God, and of Chriſt our Sauiour: yet if it be deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of a Soule or Spirit, it cannot giue life. But what is then this Life or Spirit of faith? It is euen that, as appéereth by <hi>Iames,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the which the ſaide knowledge of God in vs is dead: ſeeing that, beſide the bare know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, there is nothing which may car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vs to loue God more then our ſelues, and all other thinges: coueting to be like his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nature, which we know to be beſt &amp; moſt bleſſed: fleeing from ſinne, becauſe it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye to the nature of God: deſiring to doo good vnto all men: that <hi>we might be perfect, like our heauenly Father,</hi> ſaith Chriſt himſelfe, the maiſter of all pietie. And therefore it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be that ſame vertue, of which <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh <hi>2, Epiſt. 1. And you,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>giue all diligence, that you may ioyne with your faith vertue:</hi> Or, that which of <hi>Paule 1. Corinth. 13.</hi> is called <hi>agape,</hi> commonly tranſlated Loue, but in Latin it is rather pietie towards God, and towards men. For there <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith plainlye,
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:21193:233"/>that without this vertue our faith, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer we beléeue, yea though we vnderſtoode all ſecrets and propheſies, ſhalbe vain and vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. And this vertue hath wonderfull ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. For albeit that former part of faith, which conſiſteth in the knowledge of God and in the contemplation of heauenlye miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, hath alwaies béene highly accounted off, yet is it not to be compared with this, that is a vertue only of the minde, but this is a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue alſo of the will: that of knowledge, but this of practiſe or experience. For ſo haue the ancient Philoſophers diſtinguiſhed Vertue. Faith then endued with this heauenly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Vertue, produceth and bringeth foorth marueilous effectes in vs, euen to the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and changing of vs. For when it hath once fullye entred and poſſeſſed our will and minde both, then ſtaying (as it were) vpon theſe two pillers, it maketh vs new men, or, as Scriptures ſpeak. <hi>New creatures.</hi> For why? there groweth in vs ſo feruent a heate and loue, and ſo burning a deſire of the knowen good, that we cannot now lye ſtill or kéepe at a ſtay any longer. Inſomuch that, deteſting our former wicked life, we deſire and endeuer to liue a godly life: that we might be like him, whom we excéedingly loue. And therfore, we
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:21193:233"/>deny our ſelues, as Chriſt willeth vs, the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher and author of this life: ſo that, <hi>we ſeeme not now to liue any longer but Chriſt in vs,</hi> as <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, <hi>and we in him.</hi> For he dooth then through faith verily dwell in our hartes: ſo as <hi>we are,</hi> indeed, and not in woord only, <hi>the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Holy-ghoſt dwelling in vs,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting vs after his will, contrary to our owne will, ſo that now we will not our ſelues, but he willeth, ſpeaketh, and woorketh in vs. For ſo dooth Chriſt himſelfe, teach vs to praye and to craue, that not our will, but <hi>Gods will may be doone in vs, as it is in heauen.</hi> Thus beeing moued and affected, we doo not now only know God the father to be almighty, maker of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth, but alſo hauing throughly ſeen his great goodnes, we loue him hartilye, and reſt in him, as in our Father: ſo that, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantes and children take no care for the things pertaining to this life, nor doo not enquir what they ſhall eate, or wherewith they ſhalbe clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, but caſt all ſuch care vpon their parents, whom they know and are ſure they will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for them: and therefore doo receiue with thankes giuing, the things prouided for them by their parents: euen ſo alſo ought we to be, if we haue a true and liuelye faith in God the Father almighty. <hi>Caſt all thy care,</hi> ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:21193:234"/>
                           <hi>vpon God, and he will bring to paſſe, that which ſhalbe for thy commoditie.</hi>
                        </hi> Chriſt tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the ſelfeſame thing: <hi>What good,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall your cark and careful thought do you? For why? though yee take neuer ſo muche care for the matter, yet can ye not adde one cubit to your ſtature: no, nor make one of your haires either white or black. Why are ye then carefull for this life, and for your body? ſaying, what ſhall we eate? or, what ſhal we drink? or, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhall we be clothed? For all theſe thinges are aboundantly miniſtred of God to them that are endued with a true faith. Firſte therefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſeeke the kingdome of God, and all theſe thinges ſhalbe giuen vnto you. Beholde,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Fowles of the aier: they ſowe not, neither doo they reape: and yet God doth moſt commodiouſly ſeede them. Conſider the lilies of the feelde, how preciouſly they are apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led? but God hath a farre greater care of you, then of birdes, or then of lilies. To be ſhort, if God hath giuen you the body it ſelf, how ſhould he not giue therunto both life and clothing</hi> For he hath giuen you the greater, and therfore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo wil giue you the leſſer: as though he ſhould ſay, Onlye this I require, that ye put your truſt in me, that ye depend vpon me, that ye loue me with all your hart, and that ye thank
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:21193:234"/>me for my benefites receiued, and woorſhip me and then I for my part wil not faile in my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, I will eaſilye miniſter all thinges vnto you. They then that are endued with a true and liuely faith in God the Father, are thus affected. As for other worldlye men, they are inquiſitiue about theſe matters, and are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, <hi>What ſhall we eate? what ſhall we drink? wherwith ſhall we be clothed?</hi> How ſhall we prouide for our ſelues and our children? and therfore giue themſelues wholy to gather and heape vp riches, neither doo they make any end or keepe any meaſure: howſoeuer they heare <hi>Paule</hi> ſay, that thoſe, <hi>that wilbe rich, fall into temptation and ſnares,</hi> and into luſtes, which doo drowne men in perdition. <hi>For the loue of money,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is the roote of all euill,</hi> and the cauſe, why a great number doo wander from the true faith: and thruſt through themſelues with many ſorrowes. If ſo be then <hi>the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles doo theſe things,</hi> as Chriſt ſaith, that is to ſaye men that are eſtranged from the faith: héereby we maye gather, how few there be at this day, euen amongſt vs, that doo truely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in God the Father, ſeeing they honour him not, as their Father, reſting, as were meet and conuenient, in him. Therefore the ſaying of Chriſt ſéemeth to be moſt true, that <hi>Faith
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:21193:235"/>wil be very rare in the world, when he ſhal come to iudge the quick and the dead.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But what ſhall wee ſaye of the faith in Chriſt, may the ſame be verified of that alſo? Yea euen the very ſame. Many there are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déed euery where at this daye, which will not ſtick to ſay, that they beléeue in Chriſt crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the ſinnes of men, and they are of that minde, but they are greatly deceiued. Which that it may be vnderſtood, let vs heare Chriſt himſelfe, ſpeaking of this matter in the end of the Goſpell after <hi>Mark: <hi>Go,</hi>
                        </hi> ſaith he, <hi>preache the Goſpell to all creatures. He that beleeueth and is baptiſed, ſhalbe ſaued: he that beleueth not, ſhalbe condemned. And theſe ſignes ſhall follow them that beleene<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In my name they ſhal caſt out deuils, they ſhall lay their hands on the ſick, and they ſhall recouer: they ſhall ſpeake with new tunges, and if they drinke any deadlye thing it ſhall not hurt them.</hi> Now if I ſhould aſk you, whither you beleeued in Chriſt or no, the queſtion would ſeeme verye abſurd. For ther is no man that maketh any doubt of that matter. For why? there is none that will not ſay he beléeueth in Chriſt. But if I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of any, whither doo the ſignes that are heere mencioned of Chriſt, followe thy faith? dooſt thou heale the ſick: dooſt thou ſpeake with
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:21193:235"/>new tunges? what anſwer will he make héer? For the woordes of Chriſt are plaine. <hi>Theſe ſignes,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall follow them that beleeue:</hi> neither dooth Chriſt lye, neither will he be found falſe. If thou beleueſt truely and indéed, theſe muſt followe thy faith: but if not, thou ſuppoſeſt thou beléeueſt in Chriſt, and yet dooſt not beléeue. Heere then thou ſeeſt that vertue or power of faith, which is the life or ſpirit of faith, to be wanting in thee: and therefore thy faith is dead.</p>
                     <p>But miracles are ceaſſed, neither are they required any more. Thou ſaiſt wel, thoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall miracles are ceaſſed, either, for mens vnbeleefe, or, for that they were appointed onlye to thoſe firſt times of the Church. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding thy faith muſt not want vertue, for if it do, it is dead. There are then euen at this time alſo other miracles, in the woorking whereof our faith muſt exerciſe her power, if it be true and liuely. There are many deuils ſtill in vs, which are to be caſt out, if we will haue Chriſt to dwell in vs: the deuils, I ſay, of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſnes, ambition, enuie, euill ſpeaking, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengement, and ſuch other luſtes of the fleſh, which fight againſt the ſoule: from the which, if thou be once free, thou ſhalt afterward laye thy hands vpon other, and they ſhalbe whole,
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:21193:236"/>that is, thou ſhalt teach them the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God and of Chriſt, and they ſhall be fréed from the errors &amp; vanitie of this worlde. They ſhall ſpeake alſo with new tunges, that is to ſay, where before they were blaſphemers and all their woordes vaine and vnprofitable, nay hurtfull and peſtile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, now as though they were endued with a new tung, they ſhal ſpeak nothing, which ſhal not be referred to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, and the profit and ſaluation of men: and this is to ſpeake with newe tunges. And thus if we be diſpoſed and affected, although we ſhall drinke any deadly thing, yet ſhall we not be hurt by it. For why? neither ſhall the world, nor the fleſh with the luſtes therof, no nor Sathan himſelfe riſing vp againſt vs, be euer able to thruſt vs downe from this good and happye eſtate, and all becauſe, we ſhall cleaue faſt vnto God by this true and liuelye faith, yea we ſhall be one with him through Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Now may euerye one proue himſelfe, and weigh and conſider with himſelfe, whither he hath a liuing faith, that is to ſay, whither he caſteth theſe deuils firſt out of himſelf, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly out of others. For except we doo this, we deceiue our ſelues, and haue not that faith indeed, which might ioyne and couple vs with
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:21193:236"/>Chriſt. For why? this power or vertue is of the nature and ſubſtance of true faith, for with out this it is dead. So that, like as, if the ſoule or ſpirit ſhould return again into a dead body, that were going to the graue, the ſame would immediatly waxe hot, ſtirre, moue, and doo all other humane actions, and men would meruaile at ſo great a miracle: euen ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if that dead faith, whereby a man profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelfe to knowe God and Chriſt, haue this new vertue adioyned to it, the man ſhall begin forthwith to flame with a diuine loue, and that ſo feruently, that he ſhall frame him ſelfe wholy to the obedience of God, and ſhall chooſe rather that his will may be doon in him, and by him, then his owne: he ſhall truſt in him, and ſtay wholy vpon him: and if it be ſo, that he muſt ſuffer euen extreame tormentes paines for his glories ſake, that is, either loſſe of goods, or honour, or credit, yea or life it ſelf, he ſhal willingly and gladly doo it. And as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his neighbours (by the name of neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour all men are vnderſtood) he ſhal loue them no leſſe then himſelfe, and that not with a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affection only, but with a heauenlye, for Gods cauſe, whome he knoweth to require it at his handes. And therefore thou ſhalt neuer couet to hurt anye, but to profit all: thou ſhalt
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:21193:237"/>be readye to take wrong, rather then to doo wrong: to be beguiled, then to beguile: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that other men are alſo the ſonnes of God, that is to ſay, of thy heauenlye Father. For albeit there be ſome reprobates, and too too many: yet canſt not thou diſcearne them from Gods elect nether is it thy part ſo to doo: but, ſéeing al doo beare the image of God, thou oughteſt to loue al, but eſpecially y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly with a ſincere affection: all, I ſay, yea euen thoſe of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou haſt been hurt or iniuried any kinde of way, and ſhalt pray alſo for them that curſe thee: for they are blinde, &amp; wot not what they do. It is thy part &amp; duty therfore, to pray, that they may haue a newe hart and the eyes of their minde purged by faith: yea to further the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo with all manner of dutifulnes, gentlenes and deſerts, and to allure them, if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to repentance.</p>
                     <p>This is that ſame true and liuelye faith, which differeth much from that idle and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable faith: whereupon it followeth, that this, ſéeing it is dead, is the cauſe alſo of moſt lamentable death and mourning vnto men: and that liuely faith iuſtifieth and ſaueth man becauſe it is not dead, but endued with excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great force: not ſuch onely as wherby it remoueth mountaines, or woorketh ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:21193:237"/>but whereby it loueth God ſincerelye, and his neighbour alſo for his ſake. Wherof <hi>Paule,</hi> to conclude, ſpeaketh thus, <hi>1. Corinth. 13 <hi>Though thou couldeſt ſpeak,</hi>
                        </hi> ſaith he, <hi>not only the Latin, Greek, and Hebrue tung, but with all the tunges of men, yea and of Angells alſo: though thou haddeſt the gift of propheſie, and kneweſt all ſecrets &amp; al knowledg: yea, if thou haddeſt ſo great faith, that thou couldeſt remoue mountaines from one place to an other and yet haddeſt not loue,</hi> that is to ſaye, Conſcience and Dutie both towardes God and men, <hi>thy faith were nothing, but as a ſounding braſſe, and a tinkling Cymball.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By theſe things I ſuppoſe it appéereth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficientlye, what the true faith is, and how far foorth it differeth from the dead. It remaineth therefore onlye, that we labour and endeuer, that not béeing contented nor deciued with this, we may imbrace and holde faſt that, and vſe and exerciſe it as long as we liue: that when Chriſt in the latter daye ſhall giue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of all men, and of their faith and woorks, we may heare him, ſaying. <hi>Come yee bleſſed into the Kingdome, which was prepared for you of my Father, from the beginning of the world. For I was a ſtranger, and ye tooke me in: Naked, and ye clothed me: Hungry and thirſty,
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:21193:238"/>and ye gaue me meat and drink. For in aſmuch as ye haue doone it to the poore, and to ſuch as wanted thoſe thinges for my ſake, ye haue doon it vnto me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But, becauſe we are not able to doo theſe thinges, as we are men, we muſt heere againt entreat and beſoeche God, that he would both giue vs that faith, and ſtrength alſo to obey him. <hi>We therfore O almightye God and heauenly Father, do moſt humbly beſeech thee, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>THat this Pſalme is <hi>Dauids,</hi> it appéereth by the title of it. It is therefore commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto vs, from <hi>Dauid,</hi> as from the author thereof, who was a man endued with great faith and zeale towards God: but yet eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally from the matter and argument which if bandleth. For béere is celebrated by <hi>Dauid,</hi> the ſingular prouidence of God toward his, which he had both already tried, and euen then alſo, when he wrote this, had good experience off. He declareth therefore that God hath ſuch a continuall care and conſideration of his, that is to ſay, of faithfull and deuoute men, that he will neuer forſake them, nor leaue them deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of any thing. For firſte of all, he will mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter vnto them aboundantlye whatſoeuer is neceſſary to this preſent life. Secondly he will put from them euills and diſcommodities. Thirdly he will followe them with this ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:21193:239"/>louing kindenes of his, not for a daye or a yeere, but for euer. Finallye, which is the ſumme of all, he will haue a regarde not onlye of their bodies, but alſo and eſpecially of their ſoules: neither wil he imbrace them with this his fauour being ſeperated from him, but he will take them into his owne familie, where they ſhall worſhip him purely and ſincerelye, ſo long as they liue héere: and afterward depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from hence he will reward them with a moſt bleſſed and happy life togither with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in heauen. This is that ſame care and ſingular prouidence of God touching good and godlye men, the which <hi>Dauid</hi> hauing proued by experience ſingeth and celebrateth in this Pſalme, firſt by a certaine Allegory and ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude taken from the Shepheard of the Sheep in the firſt <hi>4.</hi> verſes, and then alſo ſimply and without a figure in the two laſt. And whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he vttreth heere touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> louing kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and fauour of God towards him, ſtandeth vpon one groundwoork or foundation, which is in the beginning of the Pſalme, where he ſaith: <hi>God is my ſhepheard, I ſhall want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:</hi> which verily is a moſt certain and ſure reaſon: but yet ſuch a one as wilbe more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, if to this <hi>Enthimeme,</hi> the propoſition which is wanting be added, in this wiſe:</p>
                     <pb n="469" facs="tcp:21193:239"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He, whoſe ſhepheard God is, can neuer lack any thing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But God, ſaith <hi>Dauid,</hi> is my ſhepheard.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Therfore, ſhall I neuer want any thing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The propoſition of this argument is ſo well knowen and certaine to all, that there was no néed to ſet it downe. For who is he (if he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and beleeue that there is a God) that knoweth not that is the only fountain of all goodnes, and almighty, and therfore can by no meanes be letted, but that he will make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom he loueth from his hart, to become moſt happy and bleſſed? And therefore this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing omitted, wherof <hi>Dauid</hi> was moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded, <hi>Dauid</hi> aſſumeth, <hi>But God is my ſhepheard:</hi> and concludeth, <hi>that he ſhall neuer want any thing.</hi> But becauſe this aſſumption might be doubted off: to witte, whither God had taken <hi>Dauid</hi> into his flock, that is to ſay, into his protection and tuition, that he might become his Shepheard, that dooth <hi>Dauid</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme by the effects of a good and diligent ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard. For he continuing the ſimilitude boro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed from the Shepheard of the ſhéepe, rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth fiue things, whereby he proueth it. What is therfore the dutie of a good ſhepheard? This was very well knowen to <hi>Dauid,</hi> though he were a King, for he himſelfe had ſometimes
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:21193:240"/>béene a Kéeper of Shéepe: he might then eaſily deſcribe the office of a good Shepheard: and this is firſt required of a good Shepheard, that he prouide his ſhéepe of ſwéete and pleſant pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures for meat, and of wholeſome and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious waters for drinke, and that renuing or reſtoring their life, he maye driue them too and fro both to the Paſtures from the ſoldes, and to the foldes from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paſtures, not through dangerous places beſet with Briers or Flint ſtones, but through plaine and ſmoothe paths, leaſt either they hurt their bodies with the bri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ers, or their feete with the ſtones. Finallye that he may diligently defend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from wilde beaſtes and from all hurt and danger. But <hi>Dauid</hi> ſheweth that God had ſo béene affected towardes him, in the three verſes next after the firſt: <hi>God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>my ſhepheard, leadeth me his ſheepe to the greene paſtures:</hi> that is, to fruitfull or pleſant paſtures, and ſuch as are commodious to feede ſhéepe, wherein I maye both conuenientlye reſt, and alſo be defended from the heate of the Sunne and from other diſcommodities. Then he leadeth me to the pleſant paſtures, where I may ſatiſfie my ſelf with holeſome hearbes at my pleaſure: and afterward to auoid the ouer great heat of the Sunne and other hurtes and annoyances, he
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:21193:240"/>cauſeth me to reſt in the foldes or coates. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlye, the ſame my <hi>Shepheard leadeth me to the waters,</hi> not violent and boiſterous like a ſtreame, for ſuch kinde of waters were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing fit either to aſſwage the thirſte, or the heat, but <hi>to the ſtill and calme running waters,</hi> with the which I may both ſatiſfie my thirſte, gotten with féeding and with the heate of the Sunne, and alſo coole and refreſhe my ſelfe. Thirdly, <hi>he reſtoreth,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and renueth my life.</hi> Which may be referred to that that went before: ſo when he leadeth me to ſuch fruitfull Paſtures, and to ſuch commodious running waters, he recreateth and refreſheth my life: or to that alſo which followeth. He reſtoreth my life, in leading me along through ſmoothe and plain pathes, or certes to them both, How dooth God reſtore the life of <hi>Dauid</hi> his ſheepe? euen by leading him to the pleſant Paſtures, and to the commodious waters to drinke, and whileſt he conuaieth him not through rough places, but through faire and plaine waies. And <hi>all this,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>he giueth vnto me for his names ſake,</hi> that is to ſay, fréely, and without anye duties or deſertes of mine. For what ſhould a poore Shéepe doo, whereby ſhe might hinde her Shepheard, to haue ſo great a care of her? and yet ſith he treateth héer of good men
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:21193:241"/>and of God their ſhepheard, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſimilitude dooth ſomewhat hault. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhepheard kepeth his ſhéep, to make his gain of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For when he is diſpoſed, he may either ſell them, or otherwiſe conuert them to the vſe of him ſelf and of his Familie, But God ſeeketh no gaine by vs: no commodities: as he that needeth no manner of thing, but referreth all thinges to our bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, nothing to his owne, which he reſpecteth not, ſeeing he is moſte perfect, and repleniſhed with all good things. How then ſhould a wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched man, or with what duties ſhould a woorm of the earth binde that moſt bleſſed Spirit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him? but God, ſeeing he is beſt of all, dooth not want till he be prouoked by vs, for that he is of his owne accord moſt ready and willing to doo vs good. And therfore ſaith <hi>Dauid, <hi>God beſtoeth al theſe benefits vpon me, for his names ſake:</hi>
                        </hi> that is for his owne ſake, and for his great goodnes ſake. In the fifth place he ſaith, <hi>Though I ſhould walke in the middeſt of the ſhadowe of death, yet will I feare no euill:</hi> in the which his ſpéeche ſeemeth to be changed. For if he had continued in that kinde of ſpéech which he vſed before, deſcribing his ſhepheard by his effectes, he would haue ſaid, <hi>He deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth me our of danger:</hi> but if the thing it ſelfe be attentiuelye marked, he ſaith both thus
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:21193:241"/>much, and ſomewhat more, as we ſhall ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. Further <hi>Dauid</hi> might ſeeme heer in this place to comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, not the diligence of his ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, but his owne vertue and ſtrength, I meane his conſtancye and couragiouſnes of minde: <hi>Though I ſhould walke in the middeſt of the ſhadowe of death,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>yet wil I feare no euill.</hi> Notwithſtanding it is not ſo, but he referreth all this to the praiſe of his ſhepheard as maye appeere by the reaſon following, <hi>for thou art with me,</hi> of which we wil ſpeak ſtrait waies, <hi>Dauid</hi> therfore in this place ſaith, that God hath ſo great a care of him, that he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and deliuereth him out of dangers, and that he will alwaies vſe the ſelfeſame fauour towards him heereafter. And therefore if any thing happen vnto him otherwiſe then wel, to wit, if he wandring like a loſt ſheepe ſhall fall into any great danger, and euen into the very ſhadowe of death it ſelfe, yet he ſaith he will fear nothing at al. And becauſe that this was a ſtrange aſſertion: for afore he had ſaide. <hi>He leadeth me to the pleaſant Paſtures, and to the quiet running waters, in this wiſe reſtoring my life, alſo he leadeth mee in the plaine pathes,</hi> all which thinges he had already proued by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, but now he ſaith, that in what perills ſoeuer he be plunged, he ſhall continuallye be
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:21193:242"/>deliuered by God, of which ſome doubt might be made: this then he fortifieth with a newe reaſon, <hi>For thou,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>art with me, thy rod and thy ſhepheards crooke comfort me.</hi> That is to ſaye, thou by thy ſpeciall good prouidence and loue towardes me, art alwaies preſent with me, and withall ſo gracious and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that therfore I neede not to feare any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, in what dangers ſoeuer I am ſet: but he ſtill perſiſteth in the ſimilitude erewhile taken from the Shepheard, and he imagineth that God is armed for his defence, and as it were ſome ſhepheard ready prepared with his ſheep hooke, that is, his ſhepheards ſtaffe to defend his ſhéepe, and therfore <hi>Though I ſhould walk</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in the ſhadowe of death,</hi> or be in the very dennes of wilde beaſtes, <hi>yet will I not be afraid,</hi> becauſe God béeing merciful is alwaies preſent with me, prepared with his ſheephooke to ſaue &amp; defend me. If the propoſition which is heere alſo wanting, be added, it wil be more apparant in this wiſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He, for whoſe defence God as a ſhepheard is prepared as it were with his Shepheards ſtaffe hath to feare nothing, in what perills ſoeuer he be placed.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>This reaſon is plaine and manifeſt, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by alſo appeereth that, which we ſaide before, to wit, that <hi>Dauid</hi> dooth not commend heere his own vertues, but the excellent prouidence of God both towardes him and his: and it is to be noted heere: that he dooth not ſay, That he ſhall not taſte of any euill or diſtreſſe héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: for he knewe well inough, as he was a wiſe man, the ſicklenes &amp; mutabilitye of mens eſtate: but this he ſaith, that he ſhal haue God alwaies mercifull and fauourable vnto him in dangers, and therfore auoucheth that he is not to feare any thing: and beſides he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceth that it will neuer come to paſſe, that by reaſon of the perils wherin he might be plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, though the horror and feare of death it ſelfe were preſent before his eyes, yet that he ſhall neede to fainte or be diſcouraged, ſeeing he hath in a readines ſuch a Shepheard and defender.</p>
                     <p>And theſe are the thinges which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth and layeth out in that continued <hi>Metoephor</hi> borowed from the Shepheard of the Shéepe: which ſelfeſame afterward he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peateth without a figure: adding alſo ſome things ouer and beſides: and he repeateth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <pb n="476" facs="tcp:21193:243"/>when he ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt prepare,</hi> that is, <hi>thou dooſt prepare,</hi> the time to come for the time preſent, which is vſuall among the <hi>Hebrues: <hi>thou prepareſt</hi>
                        </hi> therefore <hi>my table before mine aduerſaries</hi> or <hi>perſecutors: thou annointeſt my head with oyle, and my cup runneth ouer.</hi> For this is it which he had ſaid before, <hi>thou leadeſt me to the pleaſant paſtures and to the ſtill run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning waters, and that through plaine &amp; ſmothe waies, ſo reſtoring my life.</hi> Notwithſtanding in the firſt, there is further to be noted the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, which he added: <hi>before mine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries.</hi> For they are woont, that are godlye in trueth, to haue many enemies, which are deſirous of their ouerthrowe, and to haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpoyled of all their goods, and that doo they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently ſéeke, and alwaies deuiſe one thing or other againſt them: but God in deſpight of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> protecteth his, and is wont bountifully to nou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riſh and bring them vp, euen in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſight of their enemies, wherin the ſingular grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God toward his is to be ſeene. This is it therefore that <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith happened vnto him.</p>
                     <p>Now that which he addeth touching Oyle, or precious Ointment, he ſpeaketh according to the faſhion of the Cuntrey. For there was a cuſtome, that if their Feaſtes or Banquets
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:21193:243"/>were any thing coſtly, the Gueſtes were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed or annointed with Oyle and precious Ointment: as héere amongſt vs both before and after ſuch banquets the handes common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are wont to be waſhed with ſweete water. And this betokeneth the abundance and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thinges, whereunto alſo belongeth that which he addeth, <hi>My cup runneth ouer.</hi> For by theſe phraſes of ſpéech <hi>Dauid</hi> ſignifieth, that God of his goodnes had not only miniſtred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that, which was neceſſary for the main tenance of this life: but alſo he ſaith that he had giuen him ſo great plenty of al good things beſide, that ouer and aboue his neceſſary vſes he had alſo (wherin conſidering Gods bounty and liberality towards him) he might recreate and refreſhe himſelfe: God is not ſparing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his, but very bountifull, miniſtring euen thoſe things that are more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſufficient, that ſo hauing experience of his great goodnes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, they might the more willinglye and chéerefully ſerue him.</p>
                     <p>But, that which he ſetteth downe in the laſt verſe, is eſpeciallye to be marked. For he propheſieth euen of the future and perpetuall benefites of God towards him, when he ſaith, <hi>He ſhall followe me with this his fauour all the daies of my life: and I ſhall dwell in the houſe
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:21193:244"/>of the Lord for euer.</hi> For he ſignifieth that this grace ſhould be eternall, and much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall, wherein he declareth, what he looked for at Gods hand. For if ſo be a Prince ſhould make ſome one of a poore man riche, or of baſe degrée noble, and aduance him to great honour to th'intent he might ſhortly after thruſt him from it and caſt him downe headlong, this were not to be accounted a benefite, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an iniury. But God is not wont ſo to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue himſelfe toward his, that doo ſincerelye woorſhip him: this <hi>Dauid</hi> confirmeth, when he ſaith, that he is not to feare any ſuch fall, <hi>but rather,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>God will alwaies purſue me with his liberalitie and louing kindenes.</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that the chances of Fortune (as they are called) though they be ſundry &amp; vncertain, yet are not to be feared of thoſe, who haue God to be their God.</p>
                     <p>And in the laſt place he ſaith, <hi>that he ſhall dwell in the houſe of God a long time.</hi> In the which place there is ſomething more alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned, then in the former, where he entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the happines of the body and of the lif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> neceſſary for this life, ſhould be miniſtred vnto him of God, and that he ſhould alſo be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and preſerued from all euill. Thirdly, that
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:21193:244"/>theſe benefites ſhould ſo long continue, as his life did laſt: but theſe thinges though they be great, yet were they not inough, except alſo regarde might be had, and that principallye, of the ſoule, and of the heauenlye life, which is to remaine for euer moſt happy and bleſſed: of this therfore he ſpeaketh in this verſe. And firſt <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, that he ſhall not only enioye ſo many benefites, appertaining to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious paſſing of this life, and liue honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blye at home in his owne houſe: but which is much more, that he ſhall abide, <hi>in the houſe of God,</hi> to witte, in the Church: that is to ſaye, that he being endued with the ſincere know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, ſhall alwaies purelye and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentlye woorſhip him in the Church: wherein conſiſteth the foode and life of the ſoule. And where he maketh mention of the continuance of time, there is no doubt but that in theſe woordes, is concluded the hope of the heauenly and everlaſting life. For that Church or Tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple of Ieruſalem was a figure of that heuenly and celeſtiall Temple not made with hands, into the which Chriſt hauing made an eternal expiation and ſatiſfaction for ſinnes, is ſaid to be entred. <hi>Heb. 9.</hi> So then there is no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but that <hi>Dauid</hi> lifteth vp his minde to that moſt bleſſed life, when he thus ſpeaketh, and
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:21193:245"/>that he pictureth out that life in theſe woords, which was repreſented by the Temple and the diuine worſhip, and begun alreadye vpon this earth.</p>
                     <p>And therfore this is that ſingular and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Prouidence of God toward his, which <hi>Dauid</hi> hauing experienced in his own perſon, commendeth and deſcribeth in fauour of al the godly. For doubtleſſe in this Pſalme ſeemeth to be deſcribed the higheſt happines and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the way that leadeth vnto it: ſo that this Pſalme hath a patterne in it of all that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is to be deſired For why? if, for examples ſake, then haddeſt libertie giuen thée to wiſh what thou wouldeſt, what couldeſt thou bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or more deſire to haue, then that al things which are neceſſarye to the commodious paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of this preſent life, might be richlye and plentifully miniſtred vnto thée by the hand of God, euen in the deſpight of all thine enemies and euill willers. Secondly that God himſelf beeing the gouernour of this whole worlde, would ſo receiue thée into his cuſtodye and protection, that he would perpetuallye put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all euils from thée, or if at any time any aduerſitie befall thée, that he would alwaies be ſo preſent with thée, that it might nothing at all hurt and annoye thee. Further, that he
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:21193:245"/>would followe thee with this his ſo excellent fauour, not for one yéer or two, but during all the whole courſe of thy life. Finally, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing alwaies a ſpeciall care, not onlye of thy body but alſo of thy ſoule, that is to ſay, of thy chéefe and principall part, he would enlighten it with the true knowledge of his will: and not ſuffer it to wander in errors: neither graunt thee only to liue ſo commodiouſlye at home in thine owne houſe, but alſo tranſlate th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Laſt of all when the ſoule ſhall be looſed from the hands of the body, that he would tranſlate thée to the heuenly &amp; moſt happy life, where thou maiſt liue with him moſt bleſſed for euer. Then theſe things there is nothing more to be deſired: neither ſéemeth any thing to be pretermitted, that is of any weight or moment. And therfore this Pſalm contemeth a moſt perfect patterne of al things that are to be wiſhed and deſired.</p>
                     <p>Now then, we al couet that which is good: and good, the greater that it is, the more it is to be counted: we ſhould all therfore couet to be in the true and vndoubted poſſeſſion of ſo great felicitie. For who would not wiſh that he might both be partaker of all good thinges, and vtterly void of all euil, and that he might
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:21193:246"/>perpetually abide in this eſtate? againe, that being endued with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true knowledge of God, he might liue peaciblye héere, and after th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But ſo great a happines is offred to all mortall men, yea and all are inuited vnto it of God himſelf. For albeit <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeketh but of himſelfe alone, and ſaith that he was alre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy come vnto it, telling it foorth in ſuch wiſe, as though being out of all da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, he were now in ſure and certaine poſſeſſion of it: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he allureth vs by his example to the ſame thing, who may, if we liſt be happye in like manner, for that is in our power.</p>
                     <p>For why? though ſo great happines and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie come not from man, but from God (for it is altogither diuine and heauenlye) yet is it offred by him vnto vs, and of vs only to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted and entertained. We may therfore, if we will, be bleſſed: but ſure it is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we would as before is ſaid: for all men ſéeme greatly to wiſh and deſire, that they might be in that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and condition, that <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith héere he had atteined vnto: that is to ſaye, that they might haue God ſo fauourable vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that all things neceſſary for this life, ſo long as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

How is it therfore that ſo great bleſſednes and felicitie, beeing ſo excéedinglye deſired of all, is not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned of all? This ſeemeth right worthye to be diligently enquired: leaſt when all men doo earneſtlye deſire this thing, yet miſſing of the way that ledeth vnto it, they fall into extreme miſerie and diſtreſſe.</p>
                     <p>Heere <hi>Dauid</hi> dooth not only by his example brawe and allure vs thereunto, but alſo he ſheweth and pointeth out the waye, which if we would diligently keep, we might eaſily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine vnto it. And the whole deſcription of this happines, ſtandeth, as we ſaide in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, vpon this reaſon, <hi>That God is <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> Shepheard:</hi> for thereby he gathered, <hi>that he ſhould neuer want any thing.</hi> And this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, if it be generally taken, wil be no leſſe true, then if it be applyed vnto <hi>Dauid</hi> alone. For as <hi>Dauid</hi> concludeth: <hi>God is my Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard: Therefore, I ſhall not want any thing:</hi>
                        <pb n="484" facs="tcp:21193:247"/>the ſame may euerye one conclude, that will follow <hi>Dauids</hi> example and godlines. To wit in this wiſe:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>No man, that hath God to be his ſhepheard ſhall euer want any thing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But God is the ſhepheard of all good men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therfore, <hi>no good man ſhal euer want any thing.</hi> This concluſion is no leſſe true and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted, then that particular, whereby <hi>Dauid</hi> applyed vnto himſelfe, that which is common to all the faithfull. And therfore, that we may attaine vnto this happines, it ſtandeth wholy in this, that God may be our Shepheard: For if this be obteined, then he <hi>leading vs along to the pleaſant paſtures, and to the ſtill running waters, through plaine and commodious waies, will reſtore our life, and that for his holy names ſake: yea he will alwaies be mercifull vnto vs and preſent in all dangers, readye prepared with his Shepheards crooke and rod to defend vs, ſo that we ſhall neuer neede to feare any thing, no, though we were ſo neere vnto death, that we were alreadye vnder the ſhadowe of it. He will prepare a table for vs in the ſight of our enemies he will annoint our head, he will fill our cup ful of pure wine, and will alwaies follow vs with his ſo great and ſingular fauour: neither wil he nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh vs only at home in our own houſes, but he
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:21193:247"/>wil conueigh vs alſo into his, that being addop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him we may dwell and abide with him, and when this life ſhall haue an end, he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vs with a better,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>with a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly and euerlaſting.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therfore we are to labour with all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement, that we may attain this one thing namely, that God may be our Shepheard: for if ſo be he will become our ſhepheard, we may ſafly commit our ſelues &amp; our liues vnto him, he wil neuer faile in his duty dooing. How then ſhall we atteine vnto this, that God may be our Shepheard, as he was <hi>Dauids:</hi> For there muſt of neceſſitie be a certaine way vnto this thing, ſeing God, who calleth vs thither moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not nor beguileth any man, that God the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be our ſhepheard, which thing he cheeflye deſireth, for to that end hath he created vs, it is neceſſary that we become his ſheep, for theſe are ſo mutually affected betweene themſelues that the one cannot be without the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We muſt therfore take diligent heed, that the fault be not in vs, for in him we are ſure it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be. What it behoueth vs then to doo, or what manner of perſons wee ought to be, Chriſt himſelf the good Sherheard of the ſheep declareth <hi>Ioh. 10. <hi>My ſheepe,</hi>
                        </hi> ſaith he, <hi>heare my voice, and they follow me: but they know not
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:21193:248"/>the voice of a ſtranger, neither doo they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, but flie from him.</hi> Two thinges are héere to be noted, that we hearing the voice of God or of Chriſt, and acknowledging it, may followe him, whither he calleth vs and goeth before vs: ſecondly that we neither know the voice of a ſtranger, nor follow it, but flie from him: in which woordes there is no doubt, but that the ſtrength and nature of faith is contai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned, and declared: that we heare not only and vnderſtand the voice of God, and acknowledg it to be heauenlye and moſt true, but alſo that we follow it: again, that we neither acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge nor followe the voice of a ſtranger, but flie from him. But who is this ſtranger? Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, the arch-enemye of our ſaluation and of Gods glory: and our ſences, and luſtes of the fleſh, which entiſing vs with a falſe pretence of goodnes, doo carry vs away from the true good indéed. But firſte and principallye this is to be conſidered: that wee hearing the voice of the ſhepheard, may immediatly follow him: for if this be doon, the other wil follow, that we ſhal not follow a ſtranger but fly from him. Firſte héerby it appéereth that faith conſiſteth not in this, that we heare the woord of God, or alſo vnderſtand it, and acknowledge it to be the voice of God our Shepheard: no nor though
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:21193:248"/>we giue him this honour, as to iudge that to be moſt true which he ſpeaketh: but beſides it is neceſſarye that we follow him: For faith is not only in the vnderſtanding, but alſo in the will, which is the principall parte: neither is God contented with one part of vs, but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth vs wholy that he might make vs who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and altogither bleſſed. Faith then ought to occupie and poſſeſſe the whole minde of man, that is, both to enlighten the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and alſo to drawe the will to the loue of that good, which the vnderſtanding diſcerneth. And therfore if any mans vnderſtanding only be enlightned with the true and infallible knowledge of God, ſo that he knoweth Chriſt to be the Sauiour of the worlde, and can good ſkill of all the miſteries of the Chriſtian faith, and yet will not followe the voice of God or Chriſt his Shepheard, he is not to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted faithfull. For why? the vnderſtanding al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it be a great and vndoubted faith, yet is it not that wherby we are iuſtified, but it may be a certaine preparation vnto it: for vnleſſe he that heareth the voice of God, will followe it, it is manifeſt that he hath no fruit in him. For why? ſith we al couet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cheefeſt good thing and moſt ſoueraigne felicitie: and God offreth the ſame vnto all in his woord, and ſheweth
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:21193:249"/>the way that leadeth vnto it, if we follow him not, whither he calleth vs, it wil proceed from hence, that we haue no truſt in him. For ſeing we would be happye &amp; he is deſirous to make vs happy, if we would harken vnto him ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vs the way, we ſhould vndoubtedly come vnto that, which we long for: wherefore the whole miſcheefe ſpringeth from hence, that we not beléeuing him in ſo great a matter, doo ſeek another way, whereby we might come to that, that we couet and deſire. This pointe I will illuſtrate and make plaine by examples. Let vs put y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> caſe that thou wert in ſome gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous ſicknes and moſt willing and deſirous to recouer thy health, there are preſent two phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, wherof the one preſcribeth a moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and preſent remedy, and the other a moſt preſent poyſon: he aduiſeth thee very careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and earneſtly to take his wholſome potion, and diligently to beware of this deadly drink, and thou beleeueſt that Phiſition to be very ſkilful in his art and a right honeſt man: if for all this thou takeſt not that medicine preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by him, but this peſtilent pickle proffered by the other, may it not neceſſarily be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that either thou wouldeſt not be healed, or els that thou hadſt no truſt or confidence in him but that thou wouldſt not be healed, it
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:21193:249"/>cannot be ſaide in trueth: for we haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye preſuppoſed thée to be very deſirous of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering thy health: and therfore euen héerof it commeth, that thou beleeueſt not him, but the other. Or if, a man, being deſirous to goe from hence, that is to ſay from <hi>Cambridge</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> would aſke the way of thée, whereof he is ignorant, and thou ſhouldeſt tell him the right way, naming all the townes and villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, through the which the trauailers from hence to <hi>London</hi> muſt goe: and further ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt admoniſhe him, not to take the waye to the Caſtle ward, for that would leade him quite to an other place, neither could he euer come to <hi>London</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way: if he notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding (being forewarned by thée) would goe by the Caſtell, and followe that way, mighteſt thou not truely ſay that either he had no purpoſe to come at <hi>London,</hi> or els that he had no credit in thée: But to <hi>London</hi> he meant to goe: for that was agréeed vpon. Then, this one thing remaineth, that it be ſaid that he gaue no cre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dit vnto thée. For albeit he thinketh and ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth honourablye of thée, yet the thing it ſelfe teſtifieth that he had no truſt in thée touching this matter. Now leaſt that theſe thinges might ſéem ſtrange or farre off, let vs take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples but of the holye Scriptures, whereby
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:21193:250"/>this ſelfſame thing may be proued and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abraham:</hi> for he is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all men, and this of all the faithfull. What then ſhall we ſaye of <hi>Adam?</hi> God had created him after his owne image, he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed vnto him, if he would haue harkened to his voice and followed it, that is to ſay, if he would haue continued in obedience, a moſt bleſſed and eternall life: of which diuine and heauenly glory, which alſo he beheld and ſawe with the eyes of his minde, he was moſte har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilye deſirous. Now there were two trees in that Paradiſe, by the which he was admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed what he ſhould doo: the one perdy of life, wherby he vnderſtood that he ſhould liue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually with God, if ſo be he continued in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: the other of the knowledge of good and euill, of the fruit wherof he was forbidden to taſte, that ſo he might ſhun death and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. How happened it then that he ſo ſtrayed from the ſoueraigne felicitie? whereof both he was moſte deſirous to be partaker, and God moſte willing to be the beſtower of it on him? forſooth becauſe he miſtruſted God, &amp; heard the voice of a ſtranger, and followed it. For God was willing to bring him to happines, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his only duty was this to ſuffer himſelfe to be brought by him, to repoſe all his truſt
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:21193:250"/>and confidence in God, to doo nothing more then this one thing, euen to obey God: not to couet to know more then was lawfull for him to know: but to hold out and perſeuer in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. But Sathan perſwaded him (which was indéed partlye true) that if he did eate of the true knowledge of good and euil, he ſhould be a knower of good and euill, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore like vnto God, ſo that he ſhould not néede afterwarde to depende vpon God, when as knowing both good and euill, he might ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently prouide for himſelfe, and not hang at an others beck, nor acknowledge any ſuperior, as God himſelfe neither dependeth vpon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor acknowledgeth any to be aboue him: and that by this meanes he might eaſilye get to him ſelfe as great happines and felicitie as poſſiblye he could wiſh or deſire: the which he could neuer attein or come by, except he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and truſted in himſelf, and not in another: for to hang and depend vpon an other, were to ſerue and not to reigne. And therfore <hi>Adam</hi> being deceiued and circumue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by this ſpéech of the Serpent, iudged this to be a more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy way vnto that felicitie that he deſired, then to wait for it from elſe-where, and to frame his life after the will of God. He taſted ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the forbidden fruit, and his eyes were
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:21193:251"/>opened, and then he ſawe both good and had, where before he had only knowne good, to wit, that God was to be obeyed: and he knewe more then he did before, but this fell out vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily for him, yea he ſwarued vtterly from his purpoſed conceite, that is to ſaye, from the heauenlye happines, that he had longed and gaped for, becauſe that he had taſted of the tree of knowledge of good and euill, and would néedes knowe more then was expedient for him. As for <hi>Abraham</hi> he did not ſo behaue him ſelfe, but being endued with great faith, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to obey God, and to commit the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of his whole lite vnto him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when God commaunded him to departe out of his Cuntrie: he, leauing his kinſfolks, fréends and natiue ſoile behinde him, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to goe to another place: though indéede he knewe not as yet whither he ſhould goe: he went foorth ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>not knowing whither he ſhould goe.</hi> And therfore he would not eate of the tree of knowledge of good and euill, nor conſult with fleſh and blood, for that tree would haue perſwaded him, that it had béene better and more commodious to tarrye in his Cuntrey, then by leauing of it, to ſeeke ſtrange and vnknowen dwelling places, and ſuch as were poſſeſſed by others. Hee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:21193:251"/>beléeued God, becauſe he did not onlye heare his voice, or beléene God to be true, but alſo he followed him as his Shepheard: and ſo behaued himſelfe, as though he had béene noteleſſe, and out of his right minde. For who would not haue iudged him to be fooliſhe and beſide himſelfe, who for becauſe he heard Gods voice in the aier, or otherwiſe, left by and by his natiue ſoile, and all his kinſfolkes, allies, fréends, and commodities, and not knowing whither to goe, went forth notwithſtanding to the place, wherunto that voice directed him. But this is the chéefe and diuine wiſdome, for a man to yéeld greater credit vnto God, then to himſelf: nay altogither to beleeue and truſt in him, and not in himſelfe. And therefore he would not taſte of the tree of knowledge of good and euill, but iudges, and that truly, this one thing to be inough for him, euen to obey God: and that all happines conſiſted héerein, becauſe that God neuer faileth nor forſaketh them, that truſt in him. And therefore when he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to kil his Sonne without delay, he prepared himſelfe alſo to goe and to commit ſo horrible a fact: and therefore God made ſo great account of this faith of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he ſware vnto him, that becauſe he was readye to doo this thing, be
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:21193:252"/>would neuer forſake him, but enrich him with all kinde of bleſſings and benefites. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Abraham</hi> in theſe and ſuch like things ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the nature of a ſimple and kinde ſhéep, which hearing the voice of her Shepheard fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth it by and by. Thus therefore it vcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs to be affected, that we may think the waye to happines which we deſire, to conſiſt not in much knowledge, but in mighty obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: that we may euermore be in a readines euen with cloſed eyes to follow God our ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Heere to whither of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou giue credit, it will eaſilye appeere by the eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For if thou follow after pleaſures, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer thou ſpeakeſt or thinkeſt of God and of his Sonne Chriſt and Chriſtian religion, and albeit thou profeſſe thy ſelfe with thy mouth and outward ceremonies, in Baptiſme, and the Supper, and other exerciſes, to be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, yet it is manifeſt that thou beléeueſt not God, but thy ſelfe. Againe the fleſh and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil doo prouoke thée continually to the heaping vp of abundance of riches, that by this menes thou maiſt prouide for thy ſelfe and thy fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: therfore as many as giue credit vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are wholye employed in gathering of riches, ſpending and conſuming not a daye or a yéere in that exerciſe, but their whole life time, as though nothing els were to be cared for during their life: but the Holy-ghoſt to biddeth that thou ſhouldeſt not ſo gape after riches: and <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, <hi>that ſuch as deſire to be rich, fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

But the Holy ghoſt aduiſeth thee, to deſpiſe this vain-glory, and to labour conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually for the true and eternall. Heere that it may be perceiued to whither of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> twain, God or the Deuill thou haſt giuen credit (for this thing is hidden and ſecret, inaſmuch as al men doo profeſſe that they beleeue in God, as all Chriſtians wil ſay, they beleeue in Chriſt) we muſt come to the way. For if thou be a volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous perſon, if couetous, if ambitious, in which three all ſinnes and enormities may ſeeme to be comprehended: thou neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueſt God, nor Chriſt, whatſoeuer thou ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, knoweſt or beleeueſt, in what outward Church or congregation ſoeuer thou be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant,
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:21193:253"/>and in what rites and ceremonies ſoeuer thou exerciſe and buſie thy ſelfe. For euen thy Circumciſion and thy Baptiſme is turned into vncircumciſion, and thy Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and thy Supper into a prophane banquet. For ſeeing God deſcribeth, and as it were with his finger pointeth out, the very true waye vnto happines, thou muſt of neceſſitie ſay, that either thou wilt not be happy, or els that thou beleeueſt not God. But it is out of all queſtion that thou earneſtlye deſireſt the true, eternall, and moſt aſſured happines. For why? all men are of this minde, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſuch felicitie to befall them. It is a plaine caſe therfore that thou beleeueſt not God how ſoeuer he counſelleth thee for the beſt. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe neglecting the ſaide pleaſures, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightes, riches and honours, thou wouldeſt ſuffer thy ſelfe to be wholy gouerned by God, thou wouldeſt not credit thy ſelfe, thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt not taſte of the tree of knowledge of good and euill, thou wouldeſt followe God as it were with cloſed eyes, if ſo be thou diddeſt truely truſt in him. Finally thou wouldeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thy ſelfe, as Chriſt warneth thée to doo, the good Shepheard of the ſheep, and Maſter of all pietie, who profeſſeth himſelf <hi>to be the waye, the trueth, and the life.</hi> And this is it that was
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:21193:254"/>ſaide to <hi>Adam:</hi> Sée thou taſte not of the trée of knowledge of good and euill, but only obey thou me. But we are too too wiſe and cunning, we haue taſted ouer much of that vnhappye trée, and haue altogither in manner deuoured it: therefore we cannot betake our ſelues to God, nor ſuffer him to haue the whole go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of vs, for we feare leaſt he would not ſo wel prouide for vs or for ours, as were conuenient. Therefore knowing him to be both true and moſt excellent, we wiſh indéede that he would giue vs life and happines: but becauſe we doo not altogither truſt in him, we will vſe alſo all our own wiſdome &amp; induſtry, which the more that we doo, the more alſo we departe from him. For we ought in ſuch wiſe to deny our ſelues, as though there were no iot of this wiſdome, or prudence in vs, béeing moſt fullye perſwaded of this one thing, that wee ought perpetuallye to obeye God in all thinges: ſith God euery where affirmeth, that all they that will thus doo, ſhall vndoubtedlye be bleſſed. For this is the very true waye to the moſt bleſſed life, the which it behoueth us continually to keepe. We are perhaps vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, yet we may if we wil be bleſſed. But goe to, ſith we deale heere either about our chéefeſt felicitie or extremeſt miſerie, and our time is
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:21193:254"/>ſo ſhort, that after it be once gone, there will be no more place left for repentance: what letteth vs to trie, whither this be true, or no, that is to ſay, whither God will take a man, that ſhall ſo denye himſelfe, that refuſing to taſte of that deadly tree, leaſt his eyes therby might be opened to worldly vanities, will in ſuch ſort repoſe all his truſt and confidence in God, as that he will wholy depend vpon him? whither God, I ſay, wil ſo take ſuch a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his cuſtodie &amp; protection, as that he wil ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſuffer him (becauſe he denieth himſelfe for his ſake) to want any thing, either in this life, or in the life to come? Let vs, I ſaye, make a triall of the diuine Oracles, the which doo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe all theſe things to be doon: this if we ſhall doo, ther is no doubt but that this matter wil fall out very fortunately vnto vs. At leaſt wiſe let vs imitate that <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi> who when being deſirous to be healed, he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed by the Prophet to waſhe his bodye ſire times in <hi>Iorden,</hi> he not beléeuing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, refuſed at the firſt to doo it: what, ſaith he, <hi>are the waters of <hi>Iſraell</hi> better or more hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome then our waters?</hi> notwithſtanding béeing aduiſed by his ſeruants, to make a triall, and to waſh his body, which was an eaſie matter for him to doo, he waſhed it, and immediatlye
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:21193:255"/>recouered his health. Let vs therfore in like manner proue, whither we may this way, which is preſcribed vnto vs of God the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, atteine ſo great happines ſo much beſired and ſonged for The waye it ſelfe is eaſie, not hard or painefull, as that is which we follow, wherin we vexe and diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et our ſelues whole daies and nights, in gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy gaping after pleaſures, riches or promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in which point how greatly we are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, we finde daylye by experience, but then eſpeciallye ſhall we feele it when we muſt dye. But as for this way that leadeth vnto life it is peaceable and quiet, free and exempte from al theſe comberſome cares of worldly things, teaching vs to fruit onlye and alone in God. <hi>caſt thy care<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

We wil ſay ſomewhat of them both, and firſt of the Philoſophers. It hath beene enquired therefore of them, whither all thinges in the worlde come to paſſe by fatall deſtinie and by a certaine neceſſitie of nature: or whither there were ſome contingents, that is, things

<pb n="508" facs="tcp:21193:259"/>next efficient cauſe of all thinges, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny exception, that there can nothing at any time come to paſſe, which was not from all eternitie purpoſed and decreed, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is purpoſed and decreed, muſt neceſſarilye and abſolutely come to paſſe: which ſentence alſo ſome ſtrengthen and confirme by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine preſcience or fore-knowledge. For ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as that, which is foreknowen, muſt of neceſſitie come to paſſe, both in that order and manner, wherein it is foreknowen, ſeeing the knowledge of God is moſt certaine and ſure, neither can God in any wiſe be deceiued.</p>

For why: ſeeing God cannot ſinne, there will be no ſinne, if ſo be by his own proper force and power he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and diſpoſeth all things: or, which is all one, if by the force of his decree all thinges be carried after one and the ſelfſame manner, and enforced to doo that, which they doo. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſave that this neceſſitie is no leſſe to be improued, then that which is ſaide to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed either from the Starres, or from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction

For by this meanes is ouerthrowen, as they ſay, not only all good order and gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Common weale, but alſo Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which ſtandeth chéefely in the inuocation of the diuine maieſty. For in vain is entreaty made to that, which is vnintreatable.</p>
                     <p>And therfore that they might ſhunne and auoid theſe inconueniences, they imbrace the libertie of mans wil, and euery where defend it: becauſe (as ſaith <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>) <hi>that as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grace there is no ſaluation: ſo without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie or freedome Gods iuſtice is not ſeene in puniſhing of men.</hi> And in this contention (which doubtleſſe is very great) either parte hath oftetimes receiued greeuous woundes
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:21193:260"/>of other, and many thinges are obiected on both ſides, which are not ſufficientlye in all pointes anſwered. To be ſhort, the matter is come to this paſſe, that it ſeemeth there can no way be found whereby it may be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For as long as both partes are perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that they ſtrine for Gods glorye and the ſaluation of men againſt leaſing and falſhood, neither ſide will giue place to other: neither indeed (howſoeuer either of them may be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed by reaſon) will there euer want mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for them to obiect: ſo perpetuall and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſéemeth this contention like to be.</p>
                     <p>What ſhall we ſay then? that this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo long debated of the Philoſophers, moſt wiſe men, and yet vndetermined, cannot e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of Deuines, and men endued with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly wiſdome, be diſcuſſed and decided? and that God hath in this caſe laide a croſſe vpon learned men, wherin they might perpetually torment themſelues? I cannot ſo think. But if there be any way of appeaſing this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie, it ſtandeth of neceſſitie in this, that one of the parties may for a while yeelde and giue place to the other: or, that either ſide would ſo far foorth relent touching the ſtiffnes of their opinion, till as at length the matter might be throughlye agreede betwixte them.
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:21193:260"/>But it is like, that neither of both will giue place to other, becauſe that aſwell the one as the other doo perſwade themſelues that they ſtriue for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trueth againſt a lye, and for God againſt the Deuill. And therfore this ſeemeth to be the only way of compoſing this ſtrife, it ſo be the opinions of the ſtriuers might by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meanes be compared togither. And this courſe hath <hi>Aguſtine</hi> long agoe, the prince of Diuines, followed and kept, in his Book <hi>5. de Ciuirate Dei,</hi> Chap. <hi>9.</hi> where he reproueth <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> for thinking, that if the Fore-knowledge of God ſhould ſtand, which they call diuination or fore-déeming, all things muſt néedes come to paſſe of neceſſitie, as they were foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en or fore-deemed: and therfore that the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of thinges neceſſarye and contingent, ſhould vtterlye be taken awaye. Wherefore when he iudged y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if Foreknow-ledge ſhould ſtand in force, mans liberty would fall to the ground: he chooſe rather to diſanull Gods fore knowledge, then to let goe Libertie or Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: and therefore <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith of him, <hi>Whileſt he coueteth to make me free, he hath made them ſacriligious Theeues,</hi> or, <hi>robbers of God of his honour.</hi> But let vs hear <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelfe confuting ſo great an error of <hi>Tully,</hi> And I will recite his woords out of my noting

<pb n="514" facs="tcp:21193:262"/>may happen or not happen,</hi> fering, leaſt, if he ſhould ſay that they wer either true or falſe, it would follow, that they were alſo neceſſary or impoſſible: he ſaid not, that the trueth of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was as yet vnknowen vnto man, but known vnto God, as he ought to haue doon: but, <hi>That they were as yet neither true, nor falſe:</hi> by which ſaying, he took from God the Fore-knowledg at the leaſt of things Contingent: as alſo did <hi>Carneades,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>That euen <hi>Apollo</hi> himſelf could not tell of thinges to come, furtherfoorth then of ſuch whoſe cauſes were neceſſary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But as the error of <hi>Tully,</hi> the chéefe Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Philoſopher, was confuted by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> a cheefe and principall Diuine: ſo the fault of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> a moſt ſharpe witted Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, and therefore alſo of <hi>Carneades,</hi> was found out and corrected in our time by <hi>Petrus Ramus</hi> a Philoſopher of <hi>Paris.</hi> Wherby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>péereth, that ſome of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ancient Philoſophers, and Diuines at this day haue beene deceiued with this concluſion: <hi>If it be to come, and of God foreknowen, it muſt neceſſarilye come to paſſe:</hi> for this is falſe. It muſt come to paſſe indeede, but not neceſſarilye: becauſe it hath the efficient cauſe, not neceſſary, but frée and Contingent, whereby it may either be or not be. And yet notwithſtanding this is no let,
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:21193:262"/>but that God may foreſee that which is to come, as <hi>Carneades</hi> ſuppoſed, becauſe that ſo great is the quick-ſightednes of the Diuine prouidence, that it knoweth the end and iſſue, euen of thinges contingent, and which may fall out on either ſide: yea vnto God there is nothing, neither paſt nor to come, but all thinges preſent. For the knowledge of God is a ſight or viſion, comprehending al thinges (as it were) with one look or view of the eyes. The foreknowledge therefore of thinges to come is not repugnant to mans libertie, or to the nature of things contingent. For, like as it is neceſſarye that all thinges that are paſt ſhould already be fulfilled: and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſome of them had neceſſary cauſes, and therfore could not chooſe but be: and ſome had free and contingent cauſes, and therefore might either be or not be: euen ſo likewiſe, the things that are to come, ſhal al come to paſſe: but ſome of neceſſary cauſes, and cannot but be: otherſome of frée and contingent cauſes, and may fal out not to be. For the maker and Creator of this worlde would not haue all thinges to come to paſſe by neceſſary cauſes: but ſome to proceed of frée and continge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: wherin cheefly his glory dooth appéer. For thoſe thinges onely, that are frée, are capable
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:21193:263"/>of diuine power and of the heauenly and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed life.</p>
                     <p>And therfore ſome things are doone, which might not be doone: and ſome thinges are not doone, which might be doon. Wherfore <hi>Adam,</hi> when as (by the conſent of all Diuines) he might haue ſtoode, he fell: and Chriſt ſayde, <hi>That he could pray vnto his Father: and that his Father alſo could ſend twelue legions of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> whereof notwithſtanding neither came to paſſe. As therefore it is neceſſarye that all thinges alreadye paſt ſhould be doone, and yet that neceſſitie is not abſolute: but in reſpecte of the cauſe, that is, by reaſon of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the time already paſt: ſo the things that are to come, after a ſorte it is neceſſarye that they ſhould be, not abſolutely indeed, but in reſpect of the cauſe: namely, for becauſe it is determined that they ſhalbe: ſo likewiſe is it neceſſarye that all thinges that are preſent be in <hi>eſle,</hi> as, it is neceſſary for him that wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to write, as long as he writeth, and for him that ſpeaketh to ſpeak: and yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe not abſolutely, as when we ſaye, the fire burneth, or the Sunne ſhineth for it maye be that he writeth not, and that this holdeth his peace) but in regarde of the cauſe, that is, by reſon of the circumſtance of the time preſent:
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:21193:263"/>foraſmuch as <hi>Euery thing when it is, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that it be,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This therfore firſt we vnderſtand by that place of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that certaine Philoſophers being deceiued in this point, haue groeuouſlye erred. Secondly we perceiue by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame place, what the way is of quieting ſo great a diſcord. For as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> reproueth and confuteth thoſe, that of the foreknowledge of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the neceſſitie of all things, and took vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlye awaye all libertie and freedome from man, declaring that Gods foreknowledge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth right well with mans libertie: <hi>A reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious minde,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>chooſeth both, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth both, and with a godlye faith approueth both.</hi> So we alſo, ſuppoſing this to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way andmean to end &amp; determin the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie by vs propounded, haue vndertaken to defend, <hi>That the liberty of mans will is not taken away by the purpoſe and decrée of God,</hi> leaſt any man ſhould thinke Gods purpoſe and decrée to be ſuch a thing, as wherby men might be forciblye carried, as the duſt of the winde: or by whoſe force and power alone, and not by their owne, they may ſpeake, like <hi>Balaams</hi> Aſſe, and doo whatſoeuer they doo. For he that thus thinketh, is in a very great error. Neither againe doo we attribute that
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:21193:264"/>libertie to man, whereby he maye doo euery thing (for ſo ſhould be taken away not only Gods purpoſe and decrée, but mortall man ſhould be taken for a God) but whereby he may woorke and deale at libertie vnder the decrée &amp; determination of God, which is the property of that nature, that God hath made free and capable of power and life eternall.</p>
                     <p>And ſo far is it off, that this our ſentence ought worthily to diſpleſe any of ſound iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: that euen they alſo, which ſtriue and ſtruggle togither about this matter, if their meaning were throughlye ſeene into, are iuſt of this minde. For it was neuer the intent of theſe learned and ſingular men, to eſtabliſhe ſuch a purpoſe and decrée of God, as whereby alone all thinges ſhould be carried and doone without a meane, as who ſhould ſaye men, were nothing but blocks, and paſſible inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes: for if they had beene of this minde, they might woorthily haue beene gainſaide. Neither the other ſorte, if ſo be we wil indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently conſtrue their meaning, doo graunt vnto man that libertye, whereby, as he may purchaſe death and extreme miſerie, ſo alſo he may procure to him ſelfe life &amp; ſoueraigne fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie (for this would vtterly aboliſh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grace of God: which they ſay was <hi>Pelagius</hi> his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror)
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:21193:264"/>but whereby a man may in ſuch wiſe be and be ſaid to be the Lord and maiſter of his actions, as that he now alone may be deemed the author of ſinne, and God in no caſe char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged therwith. But this opinion will ſome man ſay, induceth free-wil. But what deuine euer denied, that man hath indéed ouer much will to ſinne? For this ſaying of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (if I be not deceiued,) as it is moſt famous, ſo alſo it is moſt true: <hi>To doo a thing freely, is the propertie of mans nature, and ſo coopled with reaſon, that it cannot be ſeperated from it: by dooing freely to chooſe euill, is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of corrupt nature: but to chooſe good, is the gift of grace.</hi> And therfore, to conclude, God the creator and Gouerner of all thinges is not the deſtroyer of the order by him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, but the preſeruer. For he would that in the nature of things there ſhould be diuers and ſundry cauſes, namely ſome, Neceſſarye, and otherſome alſo free &amp; contingent: which, according to their ſeuerall natures, might woorke freely and contingently, or not woork. Wherupon we conclude, that ſecondary cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are not enforced by gods purpoſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crée, but carried willinglye and after their owne nature: for bycauſe that God is the preſeruer of the order by him ſet and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

Of this therefore we alſo will ſpeake ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what,
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:21193:265"/>but bréefely, and according to the time, which we ſuppoſe to be remaining vnto vs. This Queſtion we haue giuen out, to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe that error, wherby it is defended, That we are corporallye ioyned and coupled with Chriſt, and it is thought that no fruite can o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe be reaped by him: for both theſe I ſuppoſe to be falſe, and do vnderſtand it thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That we are not corporally, but ſpiritually, and yet verily and indéed ioyned with chriſt: and made pertakers of him, and of all his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites. They that maintain that groſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction, are of this opinion, that, whereas they had rightlye conceiued in their mindes that to the atteynment of ſaluation and eter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nall life, it was neceſſary, that we ſhould be ioyned with Chriſt, to the ende we might be partakers of his life and death, and of his merits and deſertes: they ſuppoſed that this ioyning togither could not otherwiſe be, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he were there bodilye preſent where we are: and ſo might be ioyned with our bodies and mindes, which is falſe &amp; abſurd: neither, though it were true, could it yet performe that which is ſought for, that is to ſaye, it could neuer the more giue either righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes or eternall life vnto vs. We will ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore endeuour to ſhewe, that there is no
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:21193:266"/>ſuch coniunction of vs with Chriſt our head, neither, if there were, would the ſame bee wholeſome or profitable for vs: and therfore that we haue neede, if we would be ſaued, to be ſpiritually ioyned with him.</p>
                     <p>But that we may go plainely to woorke, we are to knowe, that thoſe, that maintaine the opinion, which wee impugne, are manie and ſundry. For ſome, that they might haue Chriſt corporally preſent with them, affirme that the bread and wine in the Sacrament of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> doo turne and are changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the verie bodie and blood of Chriſt, in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that after conſecration, it is not onelie Sacramentally, but alſo ſenſibly handled &amp; broken by the handes of the Prieſt, and euen waſted &amp; conſumed by the téeche of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: for that this might be graunted, <hi>Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius</hi> was inforced to confeſſe it by Pope <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas,</hi> and the generall <hi>Councell,</hi> wherein were preſente <hi>114.</hi> Biſhops: as it is had in <hi>Gracians Decree, <hi>Diſtinct. 2. chap. Ego Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius.</hi>
                        </hi> But other ſome, who diſliked of this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, deuiſed another way, whereby they might corporally bee coupled with Chriſt. They ſaid therefore that the bread and wine doo remaine: but that in them and with them the bodie and bloud of Chriſt is really &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:21193:266"/>preſent: and that this commeth to paſſe by the force and efficacie of Chriſtes wordes. But it fell out with theſe as it did with thoſe that were firſt mentioned: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that, when they could ſcarcely or not at all defend and maintaine their opinion, ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolted alſo from them, who deuiſed yet a new way, whereby, holding faſt that, as it were with tooth and naile, which they iudged ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to be doone to ſaluation, namely, that wee muſt corporally bee ioyned with Chriſt, they might maintaine and defend it: and they lay this as a foundation, That the bodie of Chriſt is euerie where, and that not by the force of the Sacramentall words, as the reſt doo: but by force of the <hi>perſonall or ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vnion:</hi> and therefore that we are corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie conioined and coupled with him. Such a like thing is <hi>Oſiander</hi> ſaide to haue dreamed of, who, that hee might deriue the eſſentiall righteouſneſſe of God, which conſiſteth in Chriſt, vnto vs, hee would haue vs in ſuche wiſe to bee ioined with him, as that there might be a reall application of one ſubſtance to another. This therefore is that which wée diſallowe, and doo thus goe about to prooue it falſe.</p>
                     <p>That ſuch a coniunction &amp; preſence might
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:21193:267"/>be eſtabliſhed, it is neceſſarie, that the bodie of Chriſt bee at once, either in manie places (wherein the firſt and ſecond ſort do agrée) or in all, as the third ſort doo holde, who of their opinion are called <hi>Vbiquiſts,</hi> or <hi>Euerywhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:</hi> but either of them is repugnant to the humane nature of Chriſt, and dooth vtterlie deſtroy it: therefore neither of both can bee true.</p>
                     <p>For, that we may ſpeake of that firſt, one bodie, though it be great, ſo long as it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth one, can be but in one place onely at one time: as for example, This bodie of mine, is wholly conteined in this ſpace of aire, which compaſſeth me about: and whither I ſtretch foorth mine armes, or my legs, or pluck them in, yet will it bee alwaies but in one place: howbeit in a greater, if it be ſtretched out: in a leſſe if it be plucked in. But if (to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue in one example) it bee deuided into a hundred parts, and euerie part be put ſeuerally in his own proper place: then my bodie, which now is one, and in one place, ſhall be in a hundred places: but not the whole in euerie one, but euerie of the partes thereof in euerie of the places. And, foraſmuch as euerie parte of my bodie, is a bodie: a bodie, I ſay, conſiſting in proportion of length, bredth, and depth: now
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:21193:267"/>ſhall not one body be in a hundred places, but a hundred bodies in ſo manie places. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they that iudge, Chriſtes bodie to bee in manie and diuers places at once, muſt either of neceſſitie deuide it into partes, or make Chriſt to haue manie bodies: but either of both is falſe and abſurde: and againſt the humaine nature of Chriſt, and a deſtruction vnto it. For why? Chriſts bodie is not to bee deuided, that it might by partes be in manie places: neither are his whole and entire bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in manie places, but remaining one and vndeuided it is in one place: in a greater place if it be greater, as, if it bee extended from the verie heauens to the earth: or in a leſſe if it be leſſe, as, if it be incloſed in the bread. For that greatnes of the bodie dooth not require manie places to bee in, but onelye a greater place: as alſo the multitude of bodies dooth require a multitude of places. This thing is ſo certaine and true, that euen the <hi>Godhead</hi> it ſelfe (though it be euerie where) yet cannot it be in diuers and ſundrie places. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it were neceſſarie, as wee ſaide before, that either it ſhould bee deuided into partes, or that it ſhould bee manifold: whereof ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is true. For, albeit to be euerie where &amp; in all places, may ſeeme to be the verie ſame
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:21193:268"/>that to bee in manie places is: yet is not the verie ſame. For to be euery where, or in all places, is not to be in many &amp; in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but in one place, agréeable to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes therof. And therfore God; ſéeing he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, is forſooth in one place, but yet in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite place, that is to ſay, euery where: and not in many and ſundrye places: for then he ſhould not be ſomwhere or in ſome place: and beſides he ſhould either be deuided or mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde. But he is ſimple and vndeuided, filling and repleniſhing all thinges, euerye where wholly, and without any diſtance of place in all and euery place.</p>
                     <p>Theſe thinges perhappes when the <hi>Vbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſts</hi> or <hi>Euerywhere men</hi> ſawe: but durſte neither deuide Chriſts body, nor multiply it: and yet would ſtill ſtiffly holde that corporall preſence: one thing that remained they ſayd, namely that Chriſts bodye is not manifolde, nor in ſundry places, but euerywhere and in all places, by reaſon of the perſonall or <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaticall</hi> vnion y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it hath with the Woord: as who ſhould ſay, that becauſe they might haue it corporally preſent in ſome fewe places (to witte, where the Lords Supper is celebrated vpon earth:) they ſuppoſed that it muſt be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where. To the confuting of which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:21193:268"/>this ſaying of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is ſufficient, <hi>Take awaye the ſpaces from bodies, and they will be no bodies:</hi> which if it be true, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe men, labouring with tooth and naile to keepe Chriſts body really preſent, haue vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued themſelues of that body. And, who ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, that to be euery where is the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of God alone? And therfore (that, we may conclude that which we propounded at the beginning) this opinion and the two former, doo deſtroye the humane nature of Chriſt, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by deuiding it, or by multiplying it, or by infinit ſtretching of it. And therfore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be true: yea, and though they were true, yet cannot that be truelye concluded, which they intend, namely, That we are corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye coupled and conioyned with Chriſt. For, when thou ſayſt that the faithfull are corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ioyned with Chriſt: thou ſayſt not only that they are ioyned togither (which no chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian man will deny) but thou determineſt alſo the mean, wherby that commeth to paſſe and thou ſayſt that it is corporall or bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: touching which pointe onely is the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and controuerſie. For it followeth not by and by, though the body of Chriſt be in many or in all places, that therfore it is corporally, that is to ſaye, after a bodily manner ioyned
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:21193:269"/>with vs: ſéeing the Godhead, which is euery where, cannot yet be ſaide corporallye to be ioyned with the Creatures: though that in it we liue, moue and haue our being. And therfore the bodye of Chriſt, is neither in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places, nor yet euerywhere, for this is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his diuine nature: neither, if it were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where or in many places, would it yet by and by followe, that we are corporallye cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled and vnited with him.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer euerye of theſe opinions haue their ſeuerall and ſundrye faultes: whereof yet we néede not to repeate euery particular. For the firſt ſaith, That the bread is changed and tranſubſtanciated into the body, and the Wine into the bloud of Chriſt: which is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry abſurd thing to be thought. For why? if thou beléeueſt that, which we confeſſe in the Créed, namely, that the body of Chriſt was made of the ſubſtance of the Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> how is it that thou contendeſt that the ſame is yet ſtil made: and that of ſome other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then of the ſubſtance of the Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> to witte Bread, whoſe ſubſtance is changed into the ſubſtance of the body of Chriſt? it had béene more tollerable to ſay, That the bread is aboliſhed and vtterlye brought to nought, and that Chriſts body dooth ſtay it ſelf in the
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:21193:269"/>place therof: and therfore the ſubtiller ſorte, which write in theſe daies of this matter, doo reiect the deuice of Tranſubſtantiation, not expreſſely in déed, but they conclude vpon that, with the which it can by no meanes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée: for they place Chriſt not corporallye, but ſpirituallye, and ſo, as he occupieth no place, in the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> The ſecond, offereth violence to Chriſts woords: <hi>This is my body:</hi> that is to ſay, in this or with this, is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye: this is a forced expoſition, if at leaſt it may be called an expoſition. The third de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth the Sacrament, whoſe dignitye it would ſéem to defend: when as, that it might haue chriſts body really preſent in it: it affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that the ſame is alſo euery where out of the ſacrament. And héerby I think it may ſufficiently appéere, that there is no ſuch cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall coniunction of Chriſt with vs: no nor yet can be: ſith neither Chriſts body, nor the manner of coniunction, which is ſet down, can by any meanes beare it.</p>
                     <p>But now we muſt ſhewe, That euen this reall and corporall coniunction, if there were any, cannot giue or procure ſaluation: which I proue thus: If there were euer any corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally conioyned with Chriſt, then was it the moſt holy Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> his Mother: for ſhe
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:21193:270"/>was bodily, ſubſtancially, and naturally ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with him, becauſe that being conceiued by the power of the Holy ghoſt, of her very ſubſtance, ſhe bare him nine monethes in her wombe, and afterward being borne ſhe gaue him ſuck, held him in her armes, and brought him vp. But the virgin <hi>Maries</hi> ſaluation was ſo far off from depending vpon this couiuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that, vnleſſe an other more néere and ſtreighter coniunction had come betwéen, ſhe had neuer entred into the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: which thing Chriſt declareth to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine woman crying out, <hi>Bleſſed is the womb that bare thee, and the pappes that gaue thee ſucke,</hi> making this anſwer, <hi>Yea rather bleſſed are they that heare the woord of God and keep it:</hi> and to them that ſaide, <hi>Thy Mother and thy bretheren ſeeke thee without: who is my Mother and my bretheren?</hi> ſaith he: <hi>whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer dooth that that God commaundeth, he is my brother, my ſiſter, and my Mother.</hi> The like may be ſaide of <hi>Simeon,</hi> who took Chriſt vp into his armes and imbraced him: and of <hi>Iohn</hi> that leaned vpon Chriſts breſt. But, that this groſſe and corporall coniunction is not of it ſelfe profitable and healthſome; <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

To what purpoſe is it then ſo greatly to vrge this bodily coniunction, whereupon yet, if there were any, our ſaluation depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not: and we were alwaies ſtill to ſéeke an other, which alone is properly neceſſary to ſaluation? for otherwiſe, what ſhall become of the fathers that died before Chriſt was borne? for why? they could not corporally eat the body of chriſt which was not as yet come into the worlde, neither could they bodily be
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:21193:271"/>ioyned with him: and yet <hi>they did eate the ſame meate that we doo, and dranck the ſame drinck,</hi> as ſaith the Apoſtle: and they were truely &amp; healthfullye ioyned with him.

                     <p>And that we may ſpeak ſomwhat alſo of this, as we promiſed, it is thus to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode.

                     <p>And therfore when it is demaunded, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be corporallye or ſpirituallye ioyned with Chriſt, this is demaunded by thoſe that doo alreadye vnderſtand, that we are ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with him: but after what manner or by what meane that is doone, whither by a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall

Therefore, this propoſition may of him be denied, who yet muſt graunt, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> diſputeth, becauſe he denieth not the thing, but the manner onely. So therefore, they that at this day deny, the faithful to eat Chriſt corporallye, or bodilye to be ioyned with him: doo not yet denye them to eate the fleſh of Chriſt, and to drinke his bloud, or to be ioyned with Chriſt: but they deny the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner expreſſed in that Aduerb: &amp; becauſe they deny that manner, it is requiſite that they appoint another, ſeeing they confeſſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction or ioyning together: and forſomuch
